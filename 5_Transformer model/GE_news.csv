1,No survivors as Ukrainian Boeing plane crashes in Iran with 176 aboard,"By Babak Dehghanpisheh and Matthias Williams  NYSE WMB  DUBAI KIEV
Reuters    A Ukrainian airliner crashed shortly after take off from
Tehran on Wednesday  bursting into flames and killing all 176 people
on board  The Boeing  NYSE BA  737 crashed hours after Iran fired
missiles at bases housing U S  forces in Iraq  and officials said
speculation about what happened was premature  Carrier Ukraine
International Airlines said the plane was last serviced two days ago
Smouldering parts and debris  including shoes and clothes  were strewn
across a field southwest of the Iranian capital where rescue workers
in face masks laid out scores of body bags   Among the victims were 82
Iranians  63 Canadians  11 Ukrainians  10 Swedes  three Germans and
three Britons  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said  A
passenger list  from the airline showed members of the same family
were killed  children were on board and many passengers were under 35
A newlywed couple that had gone to Iran to get married were among the
Canadian victims   Arash Pourzarabi  26  and Pouneh Gourji  25  were
graduate students in computer science at the University of Alberta
Four members of their wedding party were also on board with another 24
Iranian Canadians from Edmonton  said Reza Akbari  president of the
city s the Iranian Heritage Society   Oh god  I can t believe this
Akbari told Reuters   It s shocking to the whole community   Canadian
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was  shocked and saddened  and
added   Our government will continue to work closely with its
international partners to ensure that this crash is thoroughly
investigated  and that Canadians  questions are answered   It was Kiev
based Ukraine International Airlines  first fatal crash  and the
carrier said it was doing everything possible to establish the cause
Ukraine will send a team of experts to Iran later on Wednesday to
investigate the crash  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in the
Ukrainian capital  He said he had instructed Ukraine s prosecutor
general to open criminal proceedings  U S  Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo said the United States was calling for complete cooperation
with any investigation into cause of the crash and was prepared to
offer Ukraine all possible assistance  Under international rules
responsibility for investigating the crash lies with Iran  and Iranian
state television said both of the plane s black box voice and data
recorders had been found  The semi official Mehr news agency quoted
the head of Iran s civil aviation organization as saying it was not
clear which country Iran would send the black boxes to for analysis of
the data  but it would not give them to Boeing  AMATEUR VIDEO An
amateur video  run by Iranian news agencies and purportedly of the
crashing plane  showed a flash in a dark sky descending  It was
accompanied by comments that the aircraft was  on fire  and then a
brighter flash as it appears to hit the ground  Reuters could not
authenticate the footage  Iran had earlier fired missiles at the bases
housing U S  forces in Iraq in retaliation for a U S  drone strike
last week that killed an Iranian military commander  Some airlines
canceled Iran and Iraq flights and re routed others away from both
countries  airspace following the missile strikes  Safety experts say
airliner accidents rarely have a single cause and that it typically
takes months of investigation to understand all the factors behind
them  In Paris  the maker of the plane s engines  French U S  firm CFM
co owned by  General Electric   NYSE GE  and France s  Safran   PA SAF
said speculation regarding the cause was premature  Iranian TV put the
crash down to unspecified technical problems  and Iranian media quoted
a local aviation official as saying the pilot did not declare an
emergency   STATEMENT RESCINDED An official at Ukraine s embassy in
Tehran said Iranian authorities had asked it to rescind an initial
statement from Iran based on preliminary information that had blamed
the accident on engine failure  The plane that crashed was a three
year old Boeing 737 800NG en route to Kiev  Its last scheduled
maintenance was on Jan  6  the airline said   We are in contact with
our airline customer and stand by them in this difficult time  We are
ready to assist in any way needed   the manufacturer said in a
statement  The 737 800 is one of the world s most flown models with a
good safety record and does not have the software feature implicated
in crashes of the 737 MAX  Boeing grounded its 737 MAX fleet in March
after two crashes that killed 346 people  Modern aircraft are designed
and certified to cope with an engine failure shortly after take off
and to fly for extended periods on one engine  But an uncontained
engine failure releasing shrapnel can cause damage to other aircraft
systems    The U S  National Transportation Safety Board said it was
monitoring developments surrounding the crash",2020-01-08,Reuters

3,Earnings Driving General Electric Stock Toward New 52 Week High,"General Electric Co   NYSE  GE  reported fourth quarter and full year
2019 results before markets opened Wednesday  The conglomerate
reported adjusted quarterly earnings per share  EPS  of  0 21 on
revenues of  26 24 billion  In the same period a year ago  GE reported
adjusted EPS of  0 14 on revenues of  23 6 billion  Fourth quarter
results also compare to the consensus estimates for EPS of  0 18 on
revenues of  25 77 billion For the full year  GE reported total
revenues of  95 21 billion and EPS of  0 65  compared with 2018
revenues of  97 01 billion and EPS of  0 57  Analysts were looking for
EPS of  0 62 and revenues of  92 79 In the company s four segments
quarterly revenues were either flat or up slightly  Power segment
revenues were flat at  5 4 billion and health care revenues were also
flat at  5 4 billion  Renewable energy revenues rose 2  to  8 94
billion  and aviation segment revenues rose 6  to  8 94 billion div
connatix margin bottom  1 5em   div connatix img  margin  unset  Free
cash flow in the fourth quarter totaled  4 5 billion of a total  4 6
billion for the full year  These might be the two most important
numbers in GE s report The power segment posted a quarterly profit of
302 million  compared with a loss of  786 million in the year ago
quarter  The renewables posted a loss of  197 million  compared to a
loss of  21 million a year ago  Aviation segment profits rose 19  to
2 06 billion  and health care profits were up 1  at  1 18 billion CEO
Larry Culp crowed a bit The fourth quarter marked a strong close to
the year for GE  We met or exceeded our full year financial targets
and are on a positive trajectory for 2020     Our priorities looking
forward are clear  We are solidifying our financial position
continuing to strengthen our businesses as improvement efforts build
momentum  and driving long term profitable growth  We remain committed
to creating value as we continue our multi year transformation For
2020  GE expects revenues from its four segments to grow organically
in the low single digit range  Adjusted profit margin growth for these
industrial segments is forecast in a range of zero to 75 basis points
and adjusted EPS for the year is forecast in a range of  0 50 to  0 60
Free cash flow from the industrial segments is forecast at  2 billion
to  4 billion The outlook includes the disposition of BioPharma and
reduced cash from Baker Hughes  In 2019  BioPharma generated about  1
3 billion in cash and  1 5 billion in profit  while Baker Hughes
kicked in  350 million in dividend payments  Regarding its aviation
segment outlook the company said This outlook is also dependent on the
737 MAX s return to service  which GE is planning for in mid 2020  in
line with Boeing  GE expects to offset these effects through
performance improvements and reduced non operational headwinds
Analysts have estimated first quarter EPS at  0 14 on revenues of  21
39 billion  For the full year  analysts expect EPS of  0 66 on
revenues of  91 4 billion The best news from GE is that there were no
more charges related to its long term care insurance and that the
company plans to remain  focused on de risking GE Capital  including
improving its leverage profile   GE Capital posted  6 million in
earnings for the fourth quarter  compared with a loss of  177 million
in the same period last year  and the net loss for the year totaled
338 million  compared to a net loss of  2 16 billion in 2018  GE
Capital dumped assets valued at about  12 billion in 2019  topping its
target reduction of  10 billion The earnings report had no really bad
news  although full year revenues came up a bit short  as did the 2020
EPS guidance  The rise in cash flow  however  apparently forgives
myriad lesser sins GE stock traded up about 3 8  in Wednesday s
premarket  at  12 17 in a 52 week range of  7 65 to  12 24  The
consensus price target on the stock was  11 27 before the results were
reported  GE pays a quarterly dividend of  0 01  and its annual
dividend yield is 0 35   Could investors be hoping for a bit more now
that cash is flowing more freely                                 ALSO

4,Why Shares of General Electric Are Up Today,"What happened Shares of General Electric  NYSE GE  traded up more than
7  on Wednesday morning after the industry conglomerate reported
fourth quarter earnings that came in above expectations and provided
stronger than expected 2020 free cash flow guidance  GE is still in
recovery mode  but the company s outlook has improved significantly
since August  when a critic described it as  a bigger fraud than Enron
So what General Electric on Wednesday morning reported adjusted fourth
quarter earnings of  0 21 per share on revenue of  26 2 billion  ahead
of the consensus estimate for  0 18 per share in earnings on sales of
25 57 billion  Aviation led the way  with revenue up 6  year over year
and orders up 22   while renewable energy revenue was up 2  and
healthcare and power revenue were flat  Aviation margins in the
quarter  at 23   were 2 6  above the fourth quarter of 2019  and power
margins at 5 6  were more than double the average of the prior
quarters of 2019   For the year  GE recorded total revenue of  95 2
billion  down 1 9  from 2018  but industrial segment organic revenue
was up 5 5  from the year prior  And General Electric finished out the
year with  2 3 billion in industrial free cash flow  well above the
company s guidance for between  0 and  2 billion in free cash flow
General Electric is on its third CEO since 2017  plagued in recent
years by financial weakness made worse by poor acquisitions and
mismanagement  The current CEO  Larry Culp  took over in October 2018
with a mandate to divest underperforming businesses and pay down debt
The company has slowly stabilized under Culp s leadership  but still
has its share of critics  Last summer Bernie Madoff whistleblower
Harry Markopolos suggested GE s issues are far worse than the company
has disclosed  charges GE and Culp refuted  Culp in a statement
announcing earnings notes that GE had been able to reduce net debt by
7 billion in 2019 and had made progress streamlining operations   We
re proud of our progress in 2019  including decisive actions to reduce
our leverage and strengthen our businesses   Culp said   Our work
continues  but GE s committed team  exceptional technology  and global
network make me more confident than ever that we can deliver   Now
what GE said that it expects adjusted earnings of between  0 50 and  0
60 per share in 2020  and industrial cash flow of between  2 billion
and  4 billion  The earnings projection is a bit shy of the consensus
0 66 per share number going into earnings  but cash flow is
significantly above the  1 2 billion expectation  There are a lot of
unknowns heading into the year  most notably when Boeing s 737 MAX
will fly again and how much the grounding of the jet will affect GE s
airplane engine unit  GE is far from regaining the growth stock status
it enjoyed in the 1990s  and Culp and his team still have a lot of
work to do to get the power business back up and running and pay down
debt  But these results go a long way toward making the argument that
the worst is in the past for General Electric  and that s enough to
get Wall Street excited on Wednesday",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool

thanks  Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us  I ll begin
with an overview on our performance and progress on our execution
against our strategic priorities  Jamie will cover the financials in
more detail  and then we ll turn to our    our expectations for 2020
Starting on Slide 2  you ll find a snapshot of our fourth quarter and
full year results  Overall  fourth quarter marked a strong close to
the year as we met or exceeded our financial targets in 2019  Orders
were down 3  organically in the quarter as positive growth in Aviation
and Healthcare was more than offset by declines in Power and
Renewables  Notably  Aviation s double digit orders growth was driven
by our newly formed Aeroderivative JV between GE Power and Baker
Hughes following the consolidation  Excluding that JV  Aviation s
orders were up 1  For the year  total company orders closed up 1
organically  We ended 2019 with backlog of  405 billion  up 15  year
on year  This comprises equipment of  79 billion  up 2  and services
of  326 billion  up 19   representing approximately 80  of our backlog
We delivered Industrial segment organic revenue growth of 4 6  in the
quarter and 5 5  for the full year  with all segments posting positive
growth  Our service businesses  which represent about half of our
Industrial revenue in the quarter and the year  continue to be a
differentiator with our customers and a key driver of profitability
Our adjusted Industrial profit margin expanded 410 basis points and
390 basis points organically in the quarter driven by Aviation and
Power  For the year  margins expanded 60 basis points and 10 basis
points organically driven by Power and Healthcare with Aviation
margins closing above 20  We generated Industrial free cash flow of  3
9 billion in the quarter and  2 3 billion for the full year  This came
in ahead of our most recent outlook as Power outperformed expectations
and we saw continued strength in Aviation As I reflect on the year  we
ve come a long way since my initial days as CEO with each of the
businesses in late 2018  Aviation and Healthcare are clearly
exceptional franchises delivering profitable growth for the year with
runway to go  In Aviation  the business was able to grow free cash
flow versus prior year despite the  1 4 billion of cash headwind from
the Boeing 737 MAX grounding  At Healthcare  we operate at the center
of precision health  As Kieran and team outlined for many of you in
December  growth has and will continue to be driven by innovative
solutions and our digital capabilities  resulting in products such as
the Revolution Maxima CT scanner  which we launched at RSNA At Power
we re proud of our progress in stabilizing Gas Power  but we have more
to do  In Power Portfolio while there were puts and takes  we gain
better line of sight into these businesses  For example  Power
Conversion showed signs of operational improvement this year such as
better on time delivery at their facility in Brazil In Renewables  our
full year results were more mixed reflecting on each of the businesses
here in onshore wind and LM  earnings and cash trends improved through
2019  As we delivered on a steep ramp to meet customer demand  In
offshore wind  we re still in investment mode as we build our global
presence and prepare to launch the Haliade X next year  the world s
largest wind turbine  The focus in both grid solutions in hydro is
simply on the turnaround  We re working through complex projects
improving our underwriting framework and focusing on daily execution
in both our factories and in our field service organization  as well
as taking cost reduction measures  Last week I was in Paris for
operating reviews with each of these businesses and this reinforce my
conviction that we can and will improve our performance in Renewables
And in GE Capital  we delivered positive earnings driven by better
operations  tax and gains as we continue to simplify the GE Capital
portfolio  So while 2019 was year one in our multiyear transformation
I m encouraged by the evidence of momentum I see across GE Stepping
back from the quarter  we made substantial progress on our priorities
in 2019 as outlined on Slide 3  First on improving our financial
position  we move with speed on a number of deleveraging actions
which set us up to achieve our deleveraging targets in 2020  At
Industrial  we reduced net debt by  7 billion  ending the year at a
net debt to EBITDA ratio of 4 2 down from 4 8 a year ago  We used the
proceeds from our Wabtec and Baker Hughes sales to pay down debt
including a  5 billion debt tender  In 2020  we expect to close
BioPharma for about  20 billion of net proceeds and achieve our
leverage target of less than 2 5 times At Capital  we reduced debt by
7 billion ending 2019 with a debt to equity ratio of 3 9  down from 5
7 in 2018  We expect to close 2020 below our leverage target of less
than 4 times  We also completed approximately  12 billion of asset
reductions this year  bringing our two year total to  27 billion
which surpasses our  25 billion target Our deleveraging progress will
allow us to focus more of our time and energy executing on our other
priority  which is strengthening our businesses  It s no secret that
Power has been our focus over the last year and across the board we
are improving execution  In Gas Power  we re building backlog with
lower risk as evidenced by zero turnkey projects booked in the fourth
quarter  We re underwriting the business financials with more
conservative commercial assumptions  with our 2020 equipment plan now
100  in backlog  And we re rightsizing the business for today s market
through a reduction in fixed costs by 15  in the quarter and 10  in
the year versus 2018  But to be clear  we re still on a multi year
journey at Gas Power to deliver a more reliable contribution to GE
Industrials overall performance As I ve shared with you before even
our best businesses can be stronger  including Healthcare where we see
opportunity to drive faster Healthcare Systems growth post the
BioPharma sale  This year Healthcare Systems grew revenue 1
organically and we expect low to mid single digit growth going forward
We ll do this through targeted increases in R D and prioritizing
programs with the highest returns as well as better execution on our
safety  quality  delivery  and cost reduction efforts  For example
during my recent visit to Buc  France where we produce our Senographe
Pristina mammography machines  I met with our team is using lean
principles such as value stream mapping and daily management to
improve both our supply chain and our commercial performance Investing
in restructuring has also been an important effort in 2019  especially
across Power  Renewables and corporate as we reorient our cost
structure for the future and move the center of gravity to our
operating businesses  While cash and expense were lower than our
original outlook this year due to a mix of timing  attrition  and
better execution  our expected cost savings remain on track  At
corporate  for example  our core functional costs were down 8  in the
year  This was a result of our actions to shrink costs as people
processes and accountability are moved to the segments The team made
solid progress on headcount reduction  with roughly 2500 people this
year resulting in real corporate cost savings  While we re not
finished with restructuring  better margins and returns will also be
the result of improved underwriting discipline  stronger execution in
both the factory and the field  shifting our business mix more toward
services and launching accretive new products This year  much of our
substantial progress was in areas less visible to those of you on the
outside of GE  The starts would be how we run the company on a daily
basis  We re in the early days of a lean transformation  developing
leaders capable of identifying and solving problems alike
establishing standard work and embracing our values of candor
transparency and humility  Our strategic conversations are being woven
throughout the year in an ongoing sequence of operations  talent  and
budget reviews  This type of rigor and prioritization is changing how
we work As I travel to our businesses  I see real momentum building
which is only partially evident in the numbers we re sharing with you
today  For example earlier this month  David Joyce and I were in Ohio
at our Aviation component service center  which repairs complex parts
used to service our customers engines  witnessing lean principles
firsthand  The results were impressive  a 14 day improvement in our
turnaround time that will positively impact customers and our bottom
line  Moreover  we were so impressed by the operators there  motivated
passionate  expert  at using lean tools to improve their daily work  I
m excited to go back So in summary  I m heartened by our progress in
2019 and I do believe we entered the New Year  with momentum  There is
still plenty of work to do  but we re changing the way we work
together with a firm eye on delivering better results and ultimately a
stronger culture I just want to take a moment to thank all of those on
the GE team listening for their grit  the resilience  and clear sense
of ownership as we ve driven the change we have over the last year  I
m looking forward to more And with that  I ll turn it over to Jamie
Jamie S  Miller    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
OfficerThanks  Larry  Starting with the fourth quarter summary  Orders
were  24 9 billion  down 3  organically  with growth in Aviation
largely from Aero orders as well as Healthcare offset by declines in
Power and Renewables  Equipment orders were down 10  organically while
services were up 6  organically  Consolidated revenue was  26 2
billion  down 1  in the quarter  Industrial segment revenue was up 4 6
organically  with equipment revenue up 7  and services revenue up 2
and organic growth in all segments  The biggest drivers of growth were
Aviation equipment and services  Renewables equipment driven by
onshore wind and Power Services  For the year  Industrial segment
revenue was up 5 5  organically  Adjusted Industrial profit margins
were 11 3  in the quarter  up 410 basis points  reported  The majority
of margin accretion was driven by better operational rigor and the non
repeat of about  800 million of charges we took in Gas Power last year
and higher volume in Aviation services  All segments  other than
Renewables expanded margins in the quarter  For the year  we saw
significant margin expansion in Power and Healthcare  but declines in
Renewables and Aviation Fourth quarter net EPS was  0 06  continuing
EPS was  0 07  and adjusted EPS was  0 21  Walking from continuing EPS
we had  0 08 from gains in our remaining stake in Baker Hughes  which
we measure at fair value each quarter  on restructuring and other
items  we incurred  0 03 of charges related to restructuring and M A
costs across our segments  principally in Power  Next  we incurred a
0 07 charge for deal taxes related to the BioPharma transaction based
on preparatory internal restructuring ahead of the expected close in
the first quarter  Non operating pension and other benefit plans were
0 10 in the quarter  which includes about  600 million of additional
expense this quarter associated with the pension freeze we announced
in October  Excluding these items  adjusted EPS was  0 21 in the
fourth quarter Moving to cash  we generated Industrial free cash flow
of  3 9 billion for the quarter   800 million lower than prior year
Income  depreciation and amortization totaled  1 5 billion  down  200
million net of goodwill impairments versus prior year  Working capital
was positive  1 6 billion  similar to last quarter accounts receivable
was a usage of cash  driven by the impact of the MAX grounding and
reductions in long term receivables and other factoring program levels
The MAX grounding was a negative  400 million working capital cash
flow impact in the quarter  All other working capital accounts were a
source of cash  driven by lower inventory from higher seasonal volume
and cash collections on new orders and project milestones  The supply
chain finance transition was a usage of cash in the quarter as
anticipated  but less than originally planned  For the year  we
completed negotiations with over 80  of the large suppliers and
anticipate completing the transition in 2020  with results better than
our original outlook Contract assets were a source of cash at  400
million  in part driven by billings from CSA contract termination and
cash received on converting a customer to a CSA contract at Aviation
Other CFOA was  1 1 billion  which includes restructuring cash usage
accrued discount and allowance payments in aviation and non cash items
offset in net income  We also spent about  Indecipherable  in gross
capex driven by Aviation For the year  Industrial free cash flow was
2 3 billion  down  2 billion versus prior year  The most significant
driver of the decrease was in working capital due to the MAX grounding
and the reduction in certain receivable monetization programs  While
there were many puts and takes  the  2 3 billion was ahead of our
expectations  due to strong performance in Power  which carried
forward from the first half  largely driven by collections at Gas and
Steam power and partially the timing of project disbursements  lower
restructuring of about  800 million driven by the items Larry
mentioned earlier  lower impact from the supply chain finance
transition and Aviation performance were strong cash collections and
services including fourth quarter parts distribution deal for legacy
engine program and timing on discount and allowance payments helped
more than offset the  1 4 billion headwind from the MAX grounding
Moving to liquidity on Slide 6  We ended the fourth quarter with  17 6
billion of Industrial cash  up approximately  1 billion sequentially
largely driven by positive free cash flow of  3 9 billion  This was
offset partially by the  2 5 billion equity contribution to GE Capital
as planned and the  1 billion intercompany loan repayment where we
have about  12 billion left to go in 2020  In line with our ongoing
goal to reduce our reliance on short term funding  average short term
funding was  4 3 billion this quarter  down from  10 4 billion in the
fourth quarter of 2018  And peak intra quarter short term funding was
4 7 billion  down from  14 8 billion last year  Overall  our liquidity
position remains strong with over  17 billion in Industrial cash and
we continue to have access to  35 billion in bank lines and this will
step down in 2020 as we complete the BioPharma transaction and take
other deleveraging actions Next on leverage on Slide 7  We are
improving our financial position and reducing our leverage  As Larry
shared  we reduced net debt by  7 billion  ending the year with
leverage of 4 2 times  down from 4 8 times at year end 2018  This was
achieved through the  5 billion debt tender and  1 5 billion
intercompany loan repayment from GE to GE Capital and a higher cash
balance at year end  We expect to achieve our Industrial leverage goal
of less than 2 5 times net debt to EBITDA in 2020  We also announced
comprehensive US pension actions  which will reduce our net debt by  5
billion to 6 billion when completed As you may recall  as of the third
quarter  we were estimating a potential increase to our global pension
deficit of approximately  5 billion  ultimately this deficit increased
by only  900 million versus the prior year  year over year the key
drivers were pressure from the lower discount rate largely offset by
higher year end asset returns and the completion of the pension freeze
and lump sum offerings  We have substantial sources to delever and
derisk our balance sheet  To date  we have received  9 billion of
proceeds from our Wabtec and Baker Hughes sales  we are on track to
close BioPharma in the first quarter  and we ll continue to sell down
our remaining stake in Baker Hughes in an orderly fashion  Post the
BioPharma close  we will execute on the previously announced 2020
deleveraging actions that you see on the right  We ll contribute  4
billion to  5 billion to our US pension  which we expect will meet the
estimated minimum ERISA funding requirements through at least 2022  we
will also repay the remaining intercompany loan of  12 billion from GE
to GE Capital  which will be used to pay down 2020 GE Capital debt
maturities  Finally  we will repay approximately  1 billion of
maturing Industrial debt As we ve previously said  while our
Industrial leverage target will be less than 2 5 times net debt to
EBITDA  we also evaluate other measures including gross debt to EBITDA
and we will ultimately size our deleveraging actions across a range of
measures to ensure we are operating the company with a strong balance
sheet  We will evaluate additional potential actions based on their
deleveraging impact  economics  risk mitigation  and our target
capital structure while also monitoring key risks  Over 2019 and 2020
we expect that our total cash deleveraging actions will be in the
range of  30 billion Next on Power  For the quarter  orders of  4 5
billion  were down 28  organically  Power portfolio orders were down
55  organically  largely driven by the non repeat of a large steam
equipment order in fourth quarter  18  Gas Power orders were down 8
organically   Indecipherable  down 49  organically  largely driven by
the non repeat of a large turnkey order in fourth quarter of  18  We
booked 3 7 gigawatts of orders for 22 gas turbines  including three HA
units and one Aeroderivative unit  Gas Power services orders were up
12  organically  with transactional and contractual services up on
higher volume as well as commercial and utilization improvement while
upgrades were down  This was the strongest quarter of services growth
in 2019 Backlog closed at  85 billion  down 2  sequentially and flat
versus prior year  Gas Power representing  71 billion of segment
backlog was up 3   Revenue of  5 4 billion was up 5  organically with
Gas Power revenue up 9  and Power Portfolio revenue down 4   Gas Power
shipped 21 gas turbines  including five H units and three
Aeroderivative units  versus 22 turbines in the fourth quarter of  18
which included three H units and 8 Aeroderivative units  We helped our
customers achieve commercial operation on over 20 units this quarter
which translates to almost 4 5 gigawatts of new Power added to the
grid  Gas Power services revenue was up  driven by transactional and
contractual revenues  which were up on a robust fall outage season and
improved commercial performance  Upgrades were down in line with our
guidance and continued market dynamics Operating profit was  302
million  up  1 1 billion and reported segment margin was 5 6   an
increase of more than 2000 basis points  This was largely driven by
better operational rigor and stronger processes at Gas Power as we did
not incur charges related to projects  product and fleet utilization
that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018  as well as we had
improved volume  We also continue to reduce Gas Power fixed costs
which were down 15  versus the prior year For the year  organic
revenue was down 1   reflecting a decline in Power portfolio  reported
segment margin was 2 1  and free cash flow was negative  1 5 billion
While we have more to do  the team has laid a stable foundation by
base lining the business to new market realities and driving
operational improvements Next on Renewable Energy orders of  4 7
billion  were down 10  organically  due to the non repeat of large
deals at Hydro and Grid Solutions  Equipment orders were down 7  and
services orders were down 22  organically  Onshore wind orders were
flat as international strength offset a decline in North America  and
notably new order pricing in onshore wind continues to stabilize
Overall backlog of  28 billion  was flat sequentially and up 16  year
over year  Revenue of  4 7 billion was up 4  organically  mainly
driven by onshore volume  Total equipment revenue was up 3
organically as onshore wind marked record deliveries in the quarter of
1553 total turbines of repower kits with roughly two thirds of these
in the US  while services revenue was down 22  organically  Operating
profit of negative  197 million  was down  176 million and reported
segment margin was negative 4 1   a contraction of 360 basis points
Positive volume was more than offset by headwinds from project
execution particularly in grid  pricing  tariffs  and increased R D
investments  Importantly onshore was profitable for the third
consecutive quarter and full year Looking at the full year  organic
revenue was up 11   reported segment margin was negative 4 3  and free
cash flow was negative  1 billion  Renewables free cash flow was
impacted by lower earnings offset by progress collections  which were
less of a headwind in 2019 than we expected  We anticipate that
progress collections will be a headwind in 2020 as we execute on heavy
PTC delivery volume that exceeds inbound collection  As Larry noted
Renewables is a key operational focus for the team At Aviation  orders
of  10 7 billion were up 23  organically with equipment orders up 40
organically  This was primarily driven by the arrows Aeroderivative JV
Total orders excluding Aeroderivatives were up 1  organically as
commercial engine orders were down 33  due to LEAP orders down 63
while services orders were up 12   Backlog grew to  273 billion  up 8
sequentially and up 22  versus prior year  primarily driven by long
term service agreements  Revenue of  8 9 billion was up 7  organically
Equipment revenue was up 13  organically driven by sales of 420 LEAP
1A and 1B units  up 41 from last year  partially offset by CFM units
down 74   We shipped 675 units this quarter  down 11  from prior year
Services revenues were up 3  organically due to commercial services
also up 3   reflecting higher external shop visits and a more
favorable    and a more favorable mix of shop visits  Total military
sales were up 13  organically  with 227 engine unit shipments  up 32
with growth in development programs Operating profit of  2 1 billion
was up 19  organically on improved volume  price  and net productivity
offset by negative mix  Reported segment margin of 23   expanded 260
basis points versus the prior year driven by commercial aftermarket
strength  As in prior quarters this was partially offset by the CFM to
LEAP transition  which was a 60 basis point drag and the Passport
engine shipments which were a 70 basis point drag in the quarter  For
the year organic revenue was up 9   segment margin was 20 6   and free
cash flow was  4 4 billion Looking at Healthcare  we finished in line
with what we shared with you at our Investor Day in December  Orders
of  5 9 billion were up 3  organically  equipment orders were up 4
and services were up 2  organically  On a product line basis
Healthcare Systems orders were up 1  organically driven by growth in
Life Care Solutions  services and ultrasound  partially offset by
imaging largely due to market dynamics in China  In the US and Canada
Healthcare systems was up 1  organically  boosted by solid growth in
imaging and ultrasound  Life Sciences orders were up 10  organically
Backlog was  18 5 billion  up 2  sequentially and up 6  versus prior
year  Revenue of  5 4 billion was up 1  organically  Healthcare
Systems revenue was flat organically with equipment down offset by
services growth  Operating profit of  1 2 billion was flat organically
and reported segment margin was 21 9   up 10 basis points  This was
driven by volume and cost productivity  offset by tariffs  price  and
program investments  For the year  organic revenue was up 3  with
Healthcare systems up 1   Segment margin was 19 5  and free cash flow
was  2 5 billion On GE Capital  continuing operations generated net
income of  69 million  up  27 million versus the prior year  excluding
the prior year tax reform impact of  128 million  The favorability was
driven by lower marks and impairments and interest expense  partially
offset by lower gains and tax benefits and operations  For the year
continuing operations generated adjusted net income of  139 million
up  455 million versus the prior year  excluding the impact of tax
reform and the insurance annual premium deficiency test Capital ended
the quarter with  102 billion of assets  excluding liquidity  down  7
billion sequentially primarily driven by lower GECAS  WCS  and EFS
assets  GECAS completed the sale of substantially all of the PK
AirFinance business  expect    and we expect the remaining assets of
that to be sold in the first half of 2020  Capital completed asset
reductions of approximately  8 billion in the quarter for a total of
12 billion in 2019  including the  15 billion in 2018 we exceeded the
25 billion asset reduction target previously communicated  In addition
WMC concluded its Chapter 11 case in the quarter  And as of year end
GE Capital has no further liabilities to WMC Capital finished the
quarter with  19 billion of liquidity  which was up  8 billion
sequentially  primarily driven by disposition proceeds of  7 billion
and the capital infusion of  2 5 billion  partially offset by debt
maturities of  2 billion  We remain focused on derisking GE Capital
including improving its leverage profile  Capital s debt at year end
was  59 billion  down by  1 billion sequentially primarily driven by
debt maturities  partially offset by the intercompany loan repayment
of  1 5 billion We ended 2019 with the capital debt to equity ratio at
3 9 times  With the anticipated repayment of the intercompany loan
this ratio will increase throughout 2020  but we expect to end 2020 at
less than 4 times  Discontinued operations generated a net loss of  63
million  up  29 million versus the prior year driven by WMC DOJ and
other litigation reserves in 2018 As we look to 2020  insurance will
complete its annual statutory cash flow test in the first quarter and
we also expect lower earnings from GE Capital  primarily driven by
lower asset sale gains  a smaller earning asset base and other non
recurring items  but we still expect capital to breakeven by 2021
Moving to corporate adjusted operating costs were  600 million in the
quarter  up versus prior year due to higher intercompany profit
eliminations and increased remedial costs relating to existing
environmental health and safety matters  For the year  adjusted
operating costs were  1 7 billion  up  400 million versus the prior
year  largely led by the same drivers as well as the non repeat of
intangible asset sale  This was in line with our revised corporate
outlook from the previous quarter  Importantly  our core functional
costs were down 8  in the year as we move the center of gravity from
corporate to the businesses And with that  I ll turn it back over to
Larry H  Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief Executive
OfficerJamie  thanks  Before I move to our outlook  I d like to take a
moment to acknowledge our CFO transition announcement since our last
earnings call and recognize Jamie s significant contributions to GE
during her tenure  She has been a trusted partner through an
unprecedented period of change  including my own transition into the
CEO role and your complete refresh of GE s Board  portfolio moves to
make GE  a more focused industrial company and foundational shifts in
our culture to drive greater rigor and transparency  She has been
instrumental in setting and spearheading our deleveraging plan and she
will leave GE in a place where we are set to achieve those
deleveraging targets in 2020  I appreciate not only her many
contributions across the organization  but also her personal support
and partnership  On behalf of all of us  thank you  Jamie From where I
sit today I m excited and confident in our efforts to build a stronger
and more focused GE  We are planning to provide you a detailed 2020
outlook by segment on our March 4 Investor Call  but today I ll share
our expectations for the total company  So moving to Slide 10  you
will find our targets on the right hand side  We re expecting organic
growth in the low single digit range for Industrial  organic expansion
of up to 75 basis points for Industrial operating margins   0 50 to  0
60 for adjusted EPS and a range of  2 billion to  4 billion for our
Industrial free cash flow There are a number of key assumptions
underpinning our plan again this year  First is the loss cash and
earnings from dispositions  most notably BioPharma and Baker Hughes
Our outlook assumes the BioPharma sale closes in the first quarter and
a reduction of Baker Hughes dividends in line with the orderly sale of
our remaining stake  For reference  in 2019 for the full year
BioPharma generated approximately  1 3 billion in cash and  1 5
billion in profit  while Baker Hughes dividends represented
approximately  350 million of cash flow  Second is that our plan is
dependent on the 737 MAX return to service  which we are planning for
mid 2020  in line with Boeing s commentary  That said the situation
remains fluid Looking across the segments  Renewables is the key
operational focus for us in 2020  as we continue to deliver the
onshore wind ramp  invest in offshore and turnaround both Grid and
Hydro  This journey to improve earnings and cash at Renewables will
take time  We are expecting continued improvement in Power  continued
strength in Healthcare and aviation  and lower capital earnings
compared to 2019  And at each business  we are enhancing our
operational rigor and cost management  which includes continued
restructuring while non operational headwinds continue to diminish In
summary  our results will be a byproduct of delivering on our
commitments day in and day out  in the environment in which we operate
Despite areas of volatility in aggregate  we have a positive
trajectory in 2020 Moving to Slide 11  where we ve outlined our
priorities for the year  First  solidifying our financial position
Building on the actions we took in 2019 to achieve our leverage
targets  Second  continuing to strengthen our businesses over the near
to medium term  critical to this will be operating differently as our
LEAN transformation gains traction  And third  driving long term
profitable growth  which I am confident that GE team can deliver
through innovative and efficient technologies and our global network
Combined  these strengths help us build upon our valuable installed
base that keeps us close to our customers helping solve their most
important problems And with that let s take your questions  Steve
Steve Winoker    Vice President  Investor CommunicationsThanks  Larry
Before we open the line  ask everyone in the queue again to consider
your fellow analysts and ask one question and a follow up so we can
get as many people as possible  Brandon  please open the line
Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And
from Bank of America we have Andrew Obin  Please go ahead Andrew Obin
Bank of America    AnalystYes  good morning  Can you hear me Jamie S
Miller    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  good
morning H  Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief Executive
OfficerAndrew  good morning Andrew Obin    Bank of America
AnalystYeah  I just wanted to start out by expressing my thanks to
Jamie and best wishes going forward Jamie S  Miller    Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you H  Lawrence Culp  Jr
Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYou re class act Andrew Andrew
Obin    Bank of America    AnalystSo couple of questions  I ll just
ask both of them together  So the first one is Airbus has publicly
indicated that they are making sizable adjustments in payables in 2020
and we understand engines is one of the biggest components  So how
much  if any of this is baked into your 2020 forecast And the follow
up question is dynamic and power services improving  nice to see but
what are you doing differently exactly  So these are my two questions
Thanks H  Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief Executive
OfficerAndrew  as you know well we have an excellent relationship with
Airbus  I was with them just last week in fact  The guide today
relative to aviation is one  we want    we want by design to keep it
at a higher level  but as you can imagine the primary puts and takes
you are really going to be in and around the timing of the assumptions
with respect to MAX  but I think on balance we have work to do with
our friends at Airbus  we re committed to and we ll provide more of an
update in March Jamie S  Miller    Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial OfficerYeah and Andrew  as it relates Airbus  I can t
comment on their aviation payables  What I can tell you we talked on
the third quarter call about the impact of some of our timing of
payment of discount and allowances back to the airframers and this is
across the board  across multiple of our programs  there are puts and
takes  But we do see on that front  some    we saw tailwinds in 2019
we do see some headwinds in 2020 and that s baked into how we re
thinking about 2020 H  Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief
Executive OfficerAndrew  your second question  if I heard it correctly
was about Power services Andrew Obin    Bank of America
AnalystCorrect H  Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief Executive
OfficerYeah  I would say we re doing a number of things  Clearly
within Gas Power  what we see is just better commercial execution in
and around the way we are coordinating with our customers there  both
their outage schedule and our    our other CSA applications  I would
say on the transactional side  what you see the team doing or what I
saw the team do through the course of the year  it is just better more
regular call patterns  contacts  forward planning with our customers
so that we are in front of the opportunities to sell into their
installed base to the extent possible  That commercial work is really
coupled with what we re doing operationally to improve lead times  to
improve our on time delivery so that we not only are well positioned
to deliver on time and within budget scheduled outages  but we have a
better quick response capability So I think as we look at the fourth
quarter numbers  it s good to see the uptick that we did  I think if
you look at the year on balance  clearly suggests there s more work to
do and I think the team is fully committed to doing that and
continuing the exit momentum here through 2020 Andrew Obin    Bank of
America    AnalystAll right  Thank you very much OperatorFrom Wolfe
Research  we have Nigel Coe  Please go ahead Nigel Coe    Wolfe
Research    AnalystThanks  good morning Jamie S  Miller    Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Nigel Coe    Wolfe
Research    AnalystI do want to echo Andrew s comments  thanks Jamie
Good luck  You ll be missed by us  I m not sure you ll us  but good
luck Jamie S  Miller    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
OfficerThanks Nigel Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystI m sure you
won t miss these calls  that s for sure  I do want to    I do want to
touch on Aviation  Just first of all  the obviously the EBIT
performance this quarter was very impressive  I think it s a record
quarterly performance  anything unusual to factor in there or think
about  but more importantly  how do we think about the boundaries
around the MAX grounding  if production is grounded through to year
end  how do you think about the earnings and free cash impact to GE H
Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNigel let me
let us take those in reverse order  You re exactly right  In terms of
the strong performance and I would argue the strong performance for
the full year that we saw in Aviation despite the MAX headwinds  but
as we look forward I think we re looking at a more complex situation
in and around the MAX  Clearly  priority one here is safety  I think
our friends at Boeing have been crystal clear  we re going to take the
FAA s lead here and we re trying to support both Boeing and the FAA to
the fullest extent possible  I think if you look back  before we look
forward  clearly we were building engines  we were delivering to
Boeing at normal rates through 2019  We re going to see our shipment
rates fall roughly half    to half the  19 rate in  20  Clearly there
is going to be a bit of a gap here as a result relative to deliveries
and in turn that drive some of the variability that you see in the
guide I think from an operating perspective  what we re really dealing
with are three things  right  We re going to have a lower build
profile  which in turn will challenge us on the cost side  We need to
make sure that we are adjusting our cost structure accordingly  but
also taking the long view  because this will be a temporary low as
Boeing as indicated  and we will be ramping presumably later in the
year  So we want to make sure that not only our teams  but our supply
chains are prepared to rebound With the mid year return to service  we
know we re going to see fewer spare engine deliveries  Folks who are
ramping through the back half of last year in preparation for a return
to service there ll be a bit of a wall there as well that will put a
little bit of mixed pressure on us obviously  and I think we ll
continue to see fewer new orders  which are a nice source of cash for
us at least until mid year  but if that mid year return to service is
realized clearly we re going to resume deliveries and that ll be a
positive from a cash perspective in terms of just the AR that will
come in  clearly a bit of an offset relative to process or progress
liquidations So a number of moving pieces here  We re going to manage
through this as we always do  but it s not simply the setup that we
saw last year  where we were building  shipping delivering and seeing
the receivables build many more moving pieces as we look ahead to 2020
Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystThanks  Larry Jamie S  Miller
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNigel  with respect
to your second question on Aviation EBITDA quarter over quarter  we
saw strength in our aftermarket businesses at Aviation is a stronger
profitability there year over year  We also benefited from the
installed spares mix we had in the quarter  we had some variable cost
productivity and all of that was somewhat offset by higher R D and a
little bit higher SG A Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay
thanks very much H  Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief Executive
OfficerThanks Nigel OperatorFrom RBC Capital Markets  we have Deane
Dray  Please go ahead Deane Dray    RBC Capital Markets
AnalystThank you  Good morning everyone and my congratulations and
goodbye to Jamie as well Jamie S  Miller    Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Thank you Deane H  Lawrence Culp
Jr     Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Deane Deane
Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystLarry  I know were probably
going to cover this on the March 4 call  but just some bigger picture
thoughts on the approach to guidance this year  You had said earlier
that you re really not targeting EPS  specifically it s more of an
outcome and free cash flow is the target  Just remind us how we might
be seeing that in action this year  And do you have a contingency
number either implicit    implicitly or explicitly as part of this
range H  Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief Executive
OfficerDeane  as you indicated at the beginning of that question  we
ll get into a lot more detail on 4th March  I think all we really
wanted to do today quite frankly is give everybody our best look at
the fourth quarter and the quarter in the context of 2019  We thought
that given where we are in preparation for 2020  we could also share
earlier this year than we did last year the broad contours of our
outlook for the New Year  you have that  I think that again MAX is
probably the source of the greatest volatility with or range within
that guidance  clearly operationally I alluded earlier to Renewables
being a priority  not that we re done at Power  but I think we ve got
momentum there We ve clear work to do at Renewables  but  Deane  your
point  I think you re spot on  We re encouraged to look forward here
and to see a low single digit top line  with everything going on we
think we have the prospect for good margin expansion that leads to the
EPS range  but make no mistake  this team  the businesses are far more
focused on sustainable cash flow generation and that s I think what
you see in part in the  2 billion to  4 billion range for next year  I
think you see evidence of that in the way that we  the way that we
finished  And    but what you don t see in terms of the numbers  what
we see in all of our interactions with the businesses  I think it s
just a heightened level of discipline upfront  when we re talking
about new business not only in terms of price  but frankly terms
conditions  scope  everything that can go into making a new order  be
it for equipment or service  positive and accretive or not  I think
the daily management that we talk about applies in our factories when
we re building new equipment  in the field when we are installing that
same equipment in the context of projects let alone what we do in
terms of driving service quality and productivity So when you put all
that together in a long cycle business  there are going to be
different ups and downs in the course of any one quarter  but again
this team is focused on a much more sustainable higher level of free
cash performance over the long term Deane Dray    RBC Capital Markets
AnalystGot it  And just as a follow up  could you expand on the point
on Renewables where you re still in investment mode in wind
specifically H  Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief Executive
OfficerSure  The way I think about Renewables  one segment  but we ve
got  if you will  three different operating priorities in front of us
Our onshore business clearly is our most mature business in many
respects is what drives the segment  We are investing there  but you
look at the growth in onshore wind last year  very healthy double
digit level  pleased with that  We need to see that convert more
directly into margins and cash The investment reference I was making
was really with respect to offshore wind  right  You ve seen some big
numbers here in the last 90 days relative to some experts outlook for
offshore wind  This is an area where we are an innovator  We think
with Haliade X  we have an opportunity to bring an exciting technology
to market in 2021 that will help improve our overall performance  but
in the near term that is a    that s an earnings and cash drag for us
The third bit of renewables again really is the legacy Alstom JVs in
Grid and Hydro  We had a full year of the JV performance consolidated
in  19 that didn t help our reported numbers  We re a little bit
behind I think where we would like to be in terms of executing on that
turnaround  which is why we put that front and center here in 2020  I
get into that in more detail  if you d like  but those are the three
pieces  the investment call out specifically is in and around offshore
wind and the Haliade X program Deane Dray    RBC Capital Markets

Please go ahead Steve Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystHey  thanks  good
morning Jamie S  Miller    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
OfficerGood morning H  Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief
Executive OfficerGood morning  Steve  Good morning Steve Tusa
JPMorgan    AnalystCongrats on the good cash finish at the end of the
year  Can you just give us a little bit of color on the progress and
what kind of impact that ultimately had for 2019  And then also the  2
1 billion in corporate expense for free cash flow that includes the
Baker dividend  So it s even higher than that kind of on a core basis
what goes into that number  And then one more  just on kind of the
high level color you guys gave us last March on 2020 and then the 2021
commentary is that considered to be stale now  given you re going to
kind of update that in March or how should we think about those
those kind of that kind of high level guide Jamie S  Miller    Senior
Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah Steve  I ll answer your
progress question  but maybe you can repeat your second question  I
didn t quite catch that Steve Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystYes  Slide 15
the Corporate  negative  2 1 billion Jamie S  Miller    Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial OfficerOkay  Yeah Steve Tusa    JPMorgan
AnalystYeah  thanks Jamie S  Miller    Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial OfficerYeah  so on progress for the year  progress
contributed  1 3 billion in working capital inflows  Renewables and
Aviation progress and Power was up over the prior year as well When
you look at corporate  couple of big drivers there  One is just higher
cash tax payments  The other is higher restructuring and corporate and
year over year those were the two biggest drivers  When you look out
that starts to temper and come back in line with our expense levels H
Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSteve  I
think with respect to the guidance again in 30 some days we re going
to be in front of everybody with an update on how we re thinking about
20 and in the future  So I m not sure how I would characterize that
we can certainly speak to some of the moving pieces in and around the
growth and OMX again  To the earlier question  we re going to be very
focused on free cash and how we    how we step up in 2020  We think we
can do that in Aviation recognizing some of the dynamics at    in and
around the 737 MAX  I would also say  I think we know we re going to
be challenged in Renewables and probably will see them not improve
their free cash performance  probably will see a step back in 2020
but we ll take you through all the details and give you the freshest
latest consolidated view when we re together in early March Steve
Winoker    Vice President  Investor CommunicationsThanks  Steve
OperatorFrom UBS  we have Markus Mittermaier  Please go ahead Markus
Mittermaier    UBS    AnalystYeah  hi  good morning everybody  And
Jamie  thanks also from my side  On the free cash flow guidance  I
appreciate that we d get more details on that on the granularity in
March  but just high level  looks like Power came out significantly
better than what we thought maybe nine months ago  How does that
progress in the portfolio Power conversion turnaround  How do you
think about that  What s the    what s the timeline  I think you ve
taken out significant cost on the Gas Power side  what should we kind
of think about is the jumping off point into 2020 here for Power H
Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerMarkus  you
re exactly right  I mean if we look at where we finished versus where
we thought we might be back in March  Power clearly was the major
driver of the outperformance  Think Jamie referenced in her prepared
remarks a better than anticipated supply chain finance transition
there  We clearly spent less in restructuring as well  And again
despite the headwind with the MAX  Aviation was able to do a little
bit better  You put all that together  I think it s suggest  better
execution  more broadly  Again  I d like to preserve  some of the
details as we go from  19 to  20 for the March update  but much of
what s happening in Gas Power is under way within the Power portfolio
We ve got three businesses there  Power Conversion is but one  call
that roughly a  1 billion P L  where they have really grabbed the
organization firmly and are driving cost out improvements  better
quality  better delivery performance  smarter underwriting  In Power
conversion specifically  we saw really nice uptick in just household
margins in that business I give Russell Stokes who has jumped not only
looking after Power portfolio  but Power conversion specifically as
CEO  a lot of credit for the progress that they re making  I think we
do think Power again will be better as a segment next year from a cash
perspective  but still not  still not positive Markus Mittermaier
UBS    AnalystOkay  that s very helpful  And then one quick follow up
for Jamie  You already alluded to the AD As within Aviation  I think
if you remember this right  the tailwind for  19 was about  800
million  Would you expect that this reverses completely in 2020 or
that spread out over    maybe more than a year Jamie S  Miller
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  so I mentioned
on the third quarter call  800 million of favorability roughly that we
had expected in 2019  When we print the numbers  it was actually  500
million  So we did see some catch up there more than we expected in
the fourth quarter and we do expect that to reverse fully in 2020 as a
headwind Markus Mittermaier    UBS    AnalystOkay  thank you very much
H  Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks
Markus OperatorFrom Morgan Stanley  we have Josh Pokrzywinski  Please
go ahead Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHi  good
morning all Jamie S  Miller    Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial OfficerGood morning Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley
AnalystJust I guess first question  Larry  you mentioned on    within
the  4 billion or  2 billion to  4 billion range that Aviation is kind
of the biggest source of volatility or spread within that  I guess how
much of that volatility would you attribute to just timing around the
MAX  So maybe the cumulative number over the next couple of years
doesn t move around as much  but what you re actually able to capture
in 2020 is maybe a bit more volatile H  Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman
and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think that s well said  Josh  again
we don t want to get ahead of the folks at Boeing  who I know are out
here shortly  but the first order of business here in 2020 is a safe
return to service  neither Boeing nor GE is going to dictate that
schedule  the FAA will  So  again  given the building    the build
profile  the return to service date  the deliveries thereafter there
are lot of moving pieces here  And I think we just want to embrace
that reality  share what    share with you what we know and
acknowledge that even though we re putting out a range we could be in
a number of different places within it depending on how this plays out
over time But going forward  I think we have real conviction in the
LEAP engine  Clearly Boeing is one of two major customers for that
engine  and I think going forward  that should be a very healthy
relationship and a very strong program for us  How that plays out  21
and into the future  we ll see again  will defer to our colleagues at
Boeing  our customers at Boeing  but at this point  feel like we re
very much on the right track Jamie S  Miller    Senior Vice President
and Chief Financial OfficerAnd Josh  I would then add to that  that
when you think about some of the factors Larry mentioned earlier
whether it s unabsorbed overhead or the mix of installs and spares
particularly spares  but also even the timing of the return of the  1
4 billion impact we felt in 2019  as this is now a mid year reentry
into service  you should expect that we ll feel more headwinds in the
first half and more tailwinds in the second half as production rates
really normalize  So maybe that s the other factor to think about H
Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerJosh  I just
want to    I want to be clear I think we just have a lot of respect
for what s happening at Boeing today under Dave s leadership right  It
clearly have put safety first  real respect for the primacy of the FAA
pulling the end on as they did to stop the line takes a lot of guts  I
respect that  I think the focus here couldn t be clear right
recertification  then a return to service  delivering the inventory
then ultimately new production  It is complicated  but I think we see
a significant alignment at Boeing and certainly in partnership with us
and others in the supply chain  So it is clearly an unfortunate
tragedy that occurred  two tragedies to be specific  but I think going
forward  we ll all hopefully take the lessons here and build a better
stronger industry Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley
AnalystUnderstood  Appreciate that and then just quick follow up on
the PTC extension that got announced in December  Does that change the
shape of the cash profile over the next year or two at all or still
kind of where we would have been otherwise  Thanks Jamie S  Miller
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYou know  I think it
s a little hard to say  Certainly  we still expect the same level of
high PTC deliveries in the US in 2020  which will be a progress
collection drag for us as that liquidates  but the PTC extension
should help in terms of incremental new orders and some mitigating
progress collections there on the inbound  So we ll have to see a
little bit how that market plays out  but we do expect some goodness
there H  Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief Executive
OfficerThanks Josh OperatorFrom Vertical Research  we have Jeff

AnalystThank you  Good morning everyone Jamie S  Miller    Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning H  Lawrence Culp  Jr
Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Jeff Jeff Sprague
Vertical Research    AnalystJust a couple of items first back to the
MAX  Larry not to parse words  but you said your shipments to Boeing
will be    will be cut roughly in half  I wonder if you are taking
your production down that much  There has been commentary from Arconic
and others that it s very difficult to mess with these engine
production rates and And then secondly on that return to service
relative to kind of production could be kind of two different items
also given the need to induct what s in backlog etc  So if you could
just clarify your thinking on both of those I d appreciate it H
Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYou bet
Jeff  I think what we re going to do is and we are in the process of
doing is bringing our production levels down  Mindful of what s
happening at Boeing  but we re not bringing that to zero  We very much
if you will need to keep the lines wet here as we prepare not only for
the return to service  but the subsequent ramp and that s a function
of how we re going to manage our own teams and in turn suppliers like
Arconic  PCC and the rest  I know there was a comment on somebody s
call relative to this dynamic that we were going to be building more
spare engines that isn t    that is indeed not the case Just to make
sure we re all on the same page  we will probably build ahead a little
bit as we go through the year to be prepared for whatever ramp late
this year  early next year awaits us  We want to make sure we are
there in lockstep with Boeing  but we do expect our spare engine
deliveries with the 1B to come down this year  just as folks see this
pause around the return to service schedule Jeff Sprague    Vertical
Research    AnalystAnd just unrelated  but this big JV order with
Baker  did that come with the significant deposits in the quarter and
how does that impact the Aviation cash flow  if at all Jamie S  Miller
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIt did not  There was
no progress on that in the quarter Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research
AnalystThank you H  Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief Executive
OfficerThanks  Jeff OperatorFrom Barclays  we have Julian Mitchell
Please go ahead Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystHi  And maybe a
question on capital for a change  So Jamie  I heard your comments
around the leverage level likely rising through this year  you had the
2 5 billion capital infusion in Q4  What are you thinking about
further infusions from Industrial to capital in 2020  And also any
framing you can give for the commentary around lower capital earnings
this year  Thank you Jamie S  Miller    Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial OfficerYeah  so in line with what we ve said before
we do still expect to have GE to GE Capital parent support in 2020
Though it will be significantly lower than it was in 2019  Think about
it as roughly in line with the insurance statutory funding  We look at
a lot of different elements in our economic capital framework based on
the risk profiles of what we see in our businesses and what s required
to be held at our statutory insurance companies  So we do still expect
something there And then with respect to capital earnings  the biggest
couple of things to think about on 2020  we just have a smaller asset
base  So we ll have lower earnings off of a smaller asset base  And
then secondly 2019 benefited from asset sale gains  which as we ve
concluded largely are asset sale program  those just won t repeat as
we get into 2020  but as I mentioned before  we still expect capital
to be breakeven by the time we hit 2021 OperatorFrom Melius Research

Research    AnalystI ll echo prior comments  Jamie  Best of luck to
you  I m sure we ll see you hopefully down the road Jamie S  Miller
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you Scott Davis
Melius Research    AnalystIn any event  one of the questions  I wanted
to ask Larry is just that  is there somewhat of a potential positive
impact longer term on your LEAP production lines and just the slowdown
allowing your time to lean things out maybe upgrade tooling  maybe
just take another look at processes and    and just figure out how to
get that  get down the cost curve faster  Is that something real or
not H  Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerScott
I would submit that it is very real  The team  I think made real
progress in that regard coming down the cost curve in 2019  but a
slower pace here will help us not only tend to some delinquencies that
we have elsewhere  past dues that we have elsewhere across Aviation
but I think we ll also allow us to drive more and better lean
principles into all of our production operations  LEAP and elsewhere
but I think more broadly Scott  what we re most pleased by is again
the clarity of the focus  Safety first  recertification in concert
with the FAA  a safe return to service  delivery of the inventories
and then we ll ramp at a slower lower rate  Just having that clarity
goes a long way to help us best serve Boeing and our airline customers
Little bit of pause here helps  but just that clarity goes a long ways
as we think about the next couple of years and all that we can and
should do with what we    OperatorFrom Gordon Haskett  we have John
Inch  Please go ahead John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystGood
morning  everyone Jamie S  Miller    Senior Vice President and Chief

Haskett    AnalystGood morning Larry  Good morning  Steve  You guys
run all these numbers  so I m going to ask  Good morning  Steve  If
the MAX had never been grounded  would your  2 3 billion of free cash
flow have been  3 7 billion instead  And if the MAX have been
producing and flying normally since Jan  1   20  what would your  2
billion to  4 billion of 2020 Industrial guidance  what do you think
that would have been in terms of the range Jamie S  Miller    Senior
Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo 2019 the 1 4 that we ve
talked about before is the V  Phonetic  to our original expectation
So  yes  that would have been higher H  Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman
and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think with respect to 2020  given
all the moving pieces we talked about a couple of times here during
the Q and I think we would probably not want to speculate on what
might have been  I think Jamie  gives you a pretty good jumping off
point right just taking the 2  3 that we printed  the 1  4 that was
held off and then the growth that we would have seen there was there a
deduct there relative to maybe an offset in service  Very  very hard
to tell  but I think if you just step back from the MAX  If you look
at Aviation for 2020  again I think that the outlook there s probably
flat to up from a free cash perspective mindful of all the moving
pieces here in and around MAX  So again a strong franchise a number of
other non MAX related efforts with real traction delivering real
results  we ll be able to max as it comes  but long term  clearly this
is going to be our strongest cash generating business across the
portfolio Steve Winoker    Vice President  Investor

Miller    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you
Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystSo Larry  at the Healthcare day in
December  you suggested that Healthcare revenue in Q4  could be flat
to slightly down and you came in just about flat  Have you seen any
positive inflection in Healthcare Systems  either in the US with some
of the delays you were seeing under China with the new leadership you
have there and this trade issues beginning to die down  And how does
the Coronavirus complicate the outlook  if at all for your China
Healthcare Systems business in 2020 H  Lawrence Culp  Jr     Chairman
and Chief Executive OfficerAndy  I would say that it s probably too
early to point to anything in these numbers today within Healthcare
that suggests Yihao in China and Everett here in the States have had
positive impact yet  But in terms of everything I have seen  if you
will  behind the curtain the work they re doing to retool their teams
the commercial intensity and discipline they re bringing  I m really
optimistic that the commercial execution that has caused us to
underperform on a relative basis in  19 is on its way to being
remedied and we should see improvement as we go through the course of
the year  I was with the European team just last week in France  that
s a strong team as well in many respects a more challenging market
but we need to deliver on that  not just talk about it With respect to
Corona  the Coronavirus  obviously we re disheartened and sorry that
it s happening  it s a tragedy in its own right  Our priority is on
safety  clearly of our team really across GE  As you might imagine
our healthcare team is really in the smack in the middle of this  in
Wuhan and elsewhere servicing our equipment certainly prioritizing new
equipment deliveries particularly to the Wuhan hospitals  We ve made a
significant donation of patient monitors and ultrasound equipment to
help the care providers there  So there is a lot going on  And
fortunately we  we can be part of the solution there in China  but
itself a real tragedy OperatorThank you  Mr  Winoker  we ll turn it

8,What Would Light Up General Electric Stock After Earnings,"Industrial giant General Electric Co   NYSE  GE  will report fourth
quarter and full year earnings before markets open Wednesday and the
big question has to be whether the once struggling  now slowly
recovering firm can keep the music playing Analysts are looking for
adjusted earnings per share of  0 18 for the fourth quarter on revenue
of  25 77 billion  For the full year  EPS is expected to total  0 62
and revenue is forecast at  92 79 billion While those numbers are a
big improvement of the December 2018 quarter  they represent a
significant drop in how analysts view GE  After GE reported that
quarter s earnings  fiscal year 2019 revenues were forecast to reach
about  119 billion  Full year EPS was forecast at  0 84 div connatix
margin bottom  1 5em   div connatix img  margin  unset  While the
lowered expectations may be easier to meet  or even exceed   GE is
going to have to beat those expectations by more than just a penny or
two  That s not going to be easy In the third quarter  GE s cash cow
was the aviation segment that recorded  8 8 billion in sales and
profit of  1 72 billion  up 3  year over year   GE s joint venture
with French aerospace firm Safran  CFM International  manufactures the
Leap 1 B engines for Boeing s grounded 737 Max passenger jets  Boeing
s decision to stop production of the plane until further notice will
have some impact on GE s aviation segment revenue and profits
Investors expect to hear more details about that on Wednesday s
conference call Under CEO Larry Culp  GE has tried at least to stop
the decline in its power segment  Once GE s bread and butter division
revenues have been declining for years  and the company s massive
electrical power generators are getting a smaller share of a shrinking
market  In the third quarter  power segment sales totaled  3 86
billion  a year over year drop of 30  and well behind total sales of
5 02 billion in the company s renewables segment  Neither segment was
profitable  however  with power s loss totaling  144 million and
renewables  loss dropping to  98 million A third major concern remains
the possibility of further large write downs for the company s long
term care insurance business  now basically shut down  and pension
benefits contributions  benefits have been frozen for employees who
are still employed but remain unchanged for retirees   A short seller
attack in August claimed that the long term care insurance overhang
totaled more than  18 billion  not the  5 9 billion GE added to its
reserve to pay claims In October  GE said it would prefund  4 billion
to  5 billion in estimated pension funding requirements for 2021 and
2022 at the same time as it freezes its pension plan for about 20 000
employees with salaried benefits and another 700 or so executives with
supplementary pension benefits  GE also said it would offer a lump sum
payment to about 100 000 eligible former employees who have not yet
begun to receive monthly pension payments  The company s pension plan
has been closed to new members since January 2012 GE can t do much
about the issue with the 737 Max engines except try to negotiate some
compensation from Boeing  Regarding its power segment  the changes to
its pension benefits wipe out  4 billion to  6 billion of the segment
s net debt  That helps  but GE really needs to reconsider when to dump
the power business altogether  Unless it does so  fossil fuels will
continue to bleed company cash  even after the sell off GE s
controlling stake in Baker Hughes Investors have shown patience with
Culp s reconfiguration of GE  but there are still big dollars on the
table  and how the company plans to minimize the risk of losing that
cash should be more important than beating some modest expectations

9,Where Will General Electric Be in 1 Year ,"The last few years have been rough for General Electric  NYSE GE
Some of the industrial conglomerate s pain has been outside of
management s control  such as weak end markets in the energy and
utility spaces  However  a good portion of the problem was self
inflicted  including a debt heavy balance sheet  With three CEO
changes over the past five years  GE appears to finally be getting
back in shape  The next year will be an important one    especially on
the leverage front   Consequences of the financial crisis The
foundation on which every company is built is its balance sheet
Obviously  companies without any debt don t go bankrupt  but companies
with too much debt risk failure when times get tough   In the run up
to the 2007 2009 recession  GE let its financial arm expand well
beyond its original mandate of simply helping customers buy GE
products on credit  When the downturn came  the conglomerate was hit
hard and  frankly  hasn t really recovered  A string of asset sales
writedowns  and dividend cuts have left GE a shadow of its former self
It is still trying to turn things around  Some badly timed
acquisitions didn t help the situation  either  The damage is most
visible on the balance sheet today  At the end of the third quarter of
2019  GE had roughly  75 billion in long term debt and a debt to
equity ratio of roughly 1 2  That represents a vast improvement  The
company was able to cut its debt by roughly 15  through the first nine
months of 2019  Looking back a little further  its debt to equity
ratio is down from over 2 5 in 2010  so a lot of heavy lifting has
been done  But there s still a lot of work ahead when you compare GE
to some of its peers  For example  similarly iconic industrial giants
Honeywell and Emerson Electric both have debt to equity ratios of
around 0 15    What s in store for 2020 That said  GE has some big
plans that will unfold over the next year  The biggest and most
important is selling a piece of its healthcare division to Danaher for
roughly  21 billion  That deal was supposed to close in the fourth
quarter of 2019  but as of Jan  1  2020  the finalization of the
transaction hadn t been announced  GE expects the sale of this
division to provide around  20 billion of cash that can be put toward
debt reduction     Without taking anything else into consideration
that move alone would trim long term debt from  75 billion to  55
billion  That s an over 25  reduction after a single transaction  It
is a pretty big deal and will go a long way toward getting GE back on
a better financial path  It will still be more heavily leveraged than
peers  but Wall Street s concerns about debt should ease greatly   GE
Financial Debt to Equity  Quarterly  data by YCharts  The only problem
is that there are  of course  other moving parts on the balance sheet
That includes  non current compensation and benefits  liabilities
pension obligations  of over  30 billion  And  insurance liabilities
and annuity benefits  liabilities  largely leftover from GE s foray
into financial services  of roughly  40 billion  In other words  the
sale of assets to Danaher is important in that it helps alleviate the
sense of urgency  but it doesn t completely solve the bigger picture
leverage problem    Interestingly  General Electric actually reports
its balance sheet in two different ways  It has a consolidated balance
sheet and one that breaks apart its industrial business from its
finance business  That s a sign of the complexity of the situation
but helps to clarify where the problems reside  For example  virtually
all of the pension liability rests with the industrial business and
all of the insurance liability and annuity liabilities are on the
finance side  When you look at debt  the company reports  15 billion
in long term debt on the industrial side and  33 billion on the
finance side  Those two numbers don t add up to  75 billion  There s
also a line item for  long term borrowings assumed by GE   This item
is empty on the consolidated balance sheet  but is  26 billion on the
industrial side and  17 billion on the finance side of the separated
balance sheet  Those two figures don t add up to  75 billion  either
Add all of them together and you end up with a number over  90 billion
So what is going on  That s not easy to answer because there are still
a lot of unknowns at GE  particularly on the finance side of the
equation  In fact  this math alone should be enough to quash any
interest a conservative investor might have in GE  In a year it will
be better  but    There s no question that General Electric is working
hard to mend its debt heavy balance sheet  It should look much better
a year from now than it does today  However   better  does not mean
healthy   In 12 months  GE will likely still be a heavily leveraged
industrial company continuing to deal with the fallout from its ill
advised foray into finance  And none of this even takes into account
the actual operations of the company  Although GE s stock remains
around 65  below the highs it saw in 2017  suggesting there could be
some turnaround potential here  conservative investors and those that
prefer to keep things simple should probably continue to sit on the
sidelines",2020-01-04,The Motley Fool
10,Why Shares in General Electric Soared in 2019,"What happened Shares in General Electric  NYSE GE  rose 47 4  in 2019
according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  It was a
remarkable performance considering some of the operational
difficulties the company faced though the year  I ll outline the
negatives first   GE Aviation s long term aspirations have been hit by
the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX    GE s joint venture with Safran
CFM International  is the sole engine option on the aircraft    and
challenges on GE s GE9X engine have led to delays in development on
the Boeing 777X program   Renewable energy margin turned negative due
to pricing pressure and losses on legacy contracts   Outside of the
biopharma business  which is being sold to Danaher for a price that s
arguably too low  GE Healthcare revenue and orders growth have been
slightly disappointing this year   GE Power performance has improved
but management still hasn t definitively demonstrated that its
services business can recover in line with its plans   With all these
negatives  it s understandable that investors might question just what
caused the former blue chip stock s price rise in 2020   So what The
answer probably comes down to three key things  First  GE has had some
help from end markets  The aerospace aftermarket remained strong in
2019  and there are signs of stability in the gas turbine market
recall that GE Power has been the company s problem child for the last
few years   Second  CEO Larry Culp has done a good job of convincing
the market that the company is taking serious action to sell off
assets and reduce debt  The biopharma deal may not have gone through
for the best price for GE shareholders  but it will give GE around  20
billion in cash  Meanwhile  as of the third quarter  GE still had
around  9 billion in stock in Baker Hughes and Wabtec that could be
sold off  The combined  29 billion will go a long way to reducing GE s
industrial net debt of  49 billion   In addition  GE moved to freeze
employee pension benefits    a move seen as having the potential to
reduce its pension funding deficit by up to  8 billion   Third  Culp
has restored a lot of confidence in GE s management through seemingly
ending GE s run of overpromising and underdelivering  Former CEOs Jeff
Immelt and John Flannery both departed the company sticking to
earnings targets that proved unrealistic  In contrast  Culp appears to
have lowballed guidance in order to give the company easy hurdles to
jump and  in doing so  restore confidence among investors  It s worked
Now what GE stock now trades close to  12    a price that some argue
is close to a fair value    and after the hard work of restoring
credibility in the company s guidance and debt reduction plans  it s
time for GE to demonstrate some hard operational improvements  The
potential is there  particularly as the company could receive some
help from end markets  For example  GE Power s end markets appear to
be improving  and despite the 737 MAX woes  the commercial aviation
market remains in growth mode  All told  last year was a great year
for GE shareholders  but the stock will need to see more operational
progress in 2020 in order to appreciate significantly this year",2020-01-10,The Motley Fool
11,General Electric  Fixing the Balance Sheet Is Just Step One,"General Electric  NYSE GE  was once an industrial icon  lauded for its
business prowess  And then the deep 2007 to 2009 recession took the
tide out and  to paraphrase investing legend Warren Buffett  showed
that the company wasn t wearing swim trunks  GE hasn t been the same
since  as its distressed finance arm forced years of asset sales
restructuring charges  and dividend cuts  All that effort  and three
CEOs later  the company finally appears to have gotten the balance
sheet into more manageable shape  But that s just the first step in
returning GE to its former glory    Selling the crown jewels The big
news for GE today is that it is working hard to reduce debt and
finally  starting to see material progress  That s included selling
off a number of business  slowly liquidating its investment in Baker
Hughes  and most recently selling a portion of its healthcare business
one of the company s most profitable business divisions  That last one
is big  however  as it should allow GE to cut leverage by as much as
20 billion in one move     In fact  over the next year  GE s financial
position should materially improve  That s not to say it will have
solved the leverage issue  since debt will still be high relative to
peers  but management will have bought itself time  That doesn t sound
like a big win  but it is truly huge for GE and its shareholders
Where the company was once operating from a position that some have
described as desperate  it can now take its time as it works to right
the ship  Which is great news  because GE still has a lot of work
ahead of it  In fact  selling assets to raise cash might actually have
been the easy part  Now that this process is  largely  over  investors
will increasingly be paying attention to the hard work ahead  More
challenges ahead The most obvious problems facing the industrial
company s operations today are the weak margins in its power and
renewable energy divisions  These businesses serve the electricity
sector  with the power division building things like the turbines that
create electricity from steam and the renewable energy division
producing things like wind turbines  Both lost money in the third
quarter  coming in with nearly break even segment profits    That was
actually an improvement for the power division  which cut its losses
by roughly 80  year over year in the quarter  Results at renewable
energy  meanwhile  were largely unchanged  Neither  at the end of the
day  is in particularly great shape  To be fair  these divisions are
operating in difficult markets  so some of the problem is out of GE s
control  However  together power and renewable energy make up roughly
40  of GE s industrial revenues  It needs to right size these
divisions and get the businesses back into growth mode     Then there
s the two divisions  aviation and healthcare  that are doing quite
well  Segment profit margins at these two divisions were roughly 20
in the third quarter  Aviation s profits were down a little year over
year and healthcare s were up a touch  From a big picture perspective
these are strong results and at around 60  of GE s industrial revenues
provide a solid foundation on which to fix its other two major
divisions  But things aren t necessarily great here  either     For
starters  GE had to sell a portion of its healthcare business to shore
up its balance sheet  It was likely a necessary move  but one that
will reduce the size of the division and  possibly  its long term
growth prospects  Aviation  meanwhile  has to deal with the fiasco
unfolding at Boeing  GE is a key engine supplier for the grounded 737
Max jet  Although Boeing continues to work toward getting the airplane
back in the air again  it is finding additional issues that need to be
addressed before that can happen  The longer this process drags on
the greater the risk for GE  Put simply  GE has two businesses that it
needs to turn around and two that it still needs to operate
successfully    and all will require a great deal of effort and care
A healthier balance sheet helps  of course  but it doesn t lessen the
effort required     And then there s GE s finance arm  which remains
something of an unknown even after a decade of pain  GE has been
working hard to reduce the size of this division  but it is still a
big issue  For example  GE has around  33 billion in long term debt
that it attributes to the division and another  40 billion in
insurance and annuity liabilities  Although this division s adjusted
continuing earnings were flat year over year in the third quarter  and
just slightly positive  there s so much bad history that investors
should continue to consider it a material risk factor     GE data by
YCharts Next up is the not so minor fact that the SEC is investigating
GE s accounting practices  There s no way to tell how this review will
play out  but it s never good when regulators get involved in a
company s accounting  It could lead to fines  sizable one time charges
and material changes in the way GE handles its books    or it could
amount to nothing  So  as with the finance division  the SEC
investigation is a known unknown that increases uncertainty at GE  Too
many questions for conservative investors Investors have to balance
risk and reward when looking at a potential investment  GE remains
roughly 60  below its 2016 highs and is vastly improving its financial
foundation  That suggests that there could be material upside
potential  since management will have more breathing room to get the
business back on track  Because of all of the moving parts  it s hard
to put numbers on valuation here  but the company s price to sales
ratio is around 0 9 times today  notably below the roughly 1 6 times
five year average on this metric  That said  mending the balance sheet
was just the first step  GE still faces material headwinds throughout
the company that need to be dealt with  It remains a turnaround
situation that s only appropriate for aggressive investors
Conservative types should probably sit on the sidelines a bit longer",2020-01-11,The Motley Fool
12,Exclusive  India s NTPC snubs foreign emissions tech  shuts out GE  others from  2 billion orders,"By Sudarshan Varadhan NEW DELHI  Reuters    Top Indian electricity
generator NTPC has rejected the emissions cutting technology of GE and
other foreign firms for its coal fired plants  documents show
shutting them out of an estimated  2 billion in orders  Despite
struggling with some of the world s worst air pollution levels  India
has already pushed back a deadline to cut emission levels to up to
2022  after extensive lobbying by power producers who cited high costs
and technical difficulties  The rejection of the foreign technology
comes at a time when over half of coal fired plants in India are
already set to miss a phased deadline starting Dec  2019 to cut
emissions of lung diseases causing sulphur oxides  State run NTPC
which generates a quarter of India s electricity  held talks with
foreign firms including  General Electric   NYSE GE  Co  Norway based
Yara International and Japan based Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems
over the potential purchase of filters that lower emissions of smog
causing nitrogen oxide  However  none of the pilot tests it conducted
met key emissions parameters  NTPC said in a presentation submitted
last month to the Central Pollution Control Board   The pilot tests
concluded that both selective non catalytic reduction  SNCR  and
selective catalytic reduction  SCR  technologies currently available
are not suitable for installation at power plants in India   it said
in the presentation reviewed by Reuters  referring to technologies
used to cut emissions of nitrogen oxides  Thermal power companies
produce three quarters of the country s electricity and account for
some 80  of India s industrial emissions of sulphur oxides that cause
lung diseases and smog creating nitrogen oxides  NTPC had presented
cost estimates in 2016 for the installation of the technology to cut
nitrogen oxides throughout its network of power plants  According to
Reuters calculations based on those estimates  the cost would total  2
4 billion  although industry consultants said recently that those
costs could now be 25  lower  The utility wants a dilution in nitrogen
oxide emissions standards and claimed in last month s presentation
that the lowered standards can be achieved with minor retrofits
without the need to install new equipment  PILOT TESTS The pollution
board held a stakeholder meeting on Nov  7  an audio recording of
which was reviewed by Reuters  In the meeting  GE and Yara
representatives rejected NTPC s views  saying their technologies were
proven worldwide  according to the recording and two sources present
at the meeting  NTPC did not attend the meeting  NTPC  and the Indian
units of GE and Yara did not respond to detailed Reuters
questionnaires seeking comment  Mitsubishi Hitachi did not immediately
respond to a request for comment made on its website  NTPC said in the
earlier presentation to the pollution board that high ash content in
Indian coal posed challenges to installing SCR technology and that
SNCR did not meet key parameters  The foreign companies responded
saying pilot tests were run in a constrained environment and that
commercial use of the equipment  which requires some changes to the
plant  would cut emissions to the required levels   The conditions for
the  pilot  test was that we can t touch special parts at all  we can
t touch furnace tubes  NTPC did not allow us   Senthilvel Rangasamy  a
GE representative  said in the meeting  Premchand Talreja  the
managing director of the Indian unit of Yara  said the pilot tests
achieved the desired results   There should not be doubt on the
technology itself   Talreja said in the meeting  Lauri Myllyvirta  an
analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air and
previously a member of a European Union technical working group on
emissions by coal fired utilities  said India has failed to curtail
emissions due to  delay and misinformation tactics by the power
industry    The power industry managed to build a myth that Indian
coal is so special that technologies proven on a wide range of coal
types elsewhere need to be tested and validated again in India before
the standards can be implemented   Myllyvirta told Reuters",2019-12-19,Reuters
13,Special Report  Index funds invest trillions but rarely challenge management,"By Tim McLaughlin and Ross Kerber  Reuters    Index funds now control
half  the U S  stock mutual fund market  giving the biggest funds
enormous power to influence decisions and demand better returns at the
companies in which they invest trillions of dollars  But the leading U
S  index fund firms  BlackRock Inc  N BLK   Vanguard Group and  State
Street  Corp  N STT   rarely use that clout  Instead  they
overwhelmingly support the decisions and pay packages of executives at
the companies in their portfolios  including the worst performers
according to a Reuters analysis of their shareholder voting records
The three fund firms  for instance  supported doubling the pay of the
chief executive at California utility PG E Corp  N PCG  after its
stock plummeted over potential liability from maintenance problems
linked to California wildfires  The funds supported big pay packages
for executives at beauty products company  Coty Inc   N COTY
including nearly  500 000 for their children s tuition   as the
company struggled to digest its acquisition of Procter   Gamble s
beauty business  And all three cast pivotal votes against the proposed
reform of splitting the CEO and chairman roles at  General Electric
Co  N GE  after a decade of poor performance  Such votes reflect a
larger trend of deference to management  according to an analysis of
proxy voting at 300 of the worst performing companies in the Russell
3000 index  as measured by three year returns through the end of 2018
The analysis was conducted for Reuters by shareholder voting data firm
Proxy Insight   The study looked at the 300 worst performers who held
proxy votes in 2018  It found that BlackRock voted with management 93
of the time  followed by Vanguard at 91  and State Street at 84
during the proxy year ended June 30  2018  The analysis showed that
the three index fund firms supported management at the worst
performing Russell 3000 firms only slightly less often than they did
for all companies in the index  regardless of performance   If we
think that informed and engaged shareholders play an important role in
disciplining company management  the rise of index investing is a
problem   said Dorothy Lund  a law professor at USC s Gould School of
Law and an author of several published corporate governance studies
Actively managed funds also routinely support management in proxy
ballots  But their voting records are not directly comparable to those
of index funds because active managers routinely signal their
displeasure with company management by simply dumping a stock or never
buying it  Index funds  by contrast  are prevented from active trading
by their own rules because they aim to match  rather than beat  the
market  They are required to own all the companies in the index they
track  such as the Russell 3000 or the S P 500   high flyers and dogs
alike  That leaves proxy voting as the primary leverage for index
funds firms to hold companies accountable for practices that undermine
shareholders  interests  such as exorbitant executive pay  But the
index providers face powerful disincentives in confronting management
at the companies in their portfolios  industry experts said   With no
mission to outperform market indices  the funds lack a financial
incentive to ensure that portfolio companies are well run  Lund said
Their business models also rely heavily on recruiting everyday
investors away from actively managed mutual funds with the promise of
lower fees  And large companies   like the ones in major stock indexes
are key to acquiring new customers for the big fund firms  BlackRock
Vanguard and rival firms count on corporations to offer their funds to
employees in retirement plans  which often limit the options workers
can select  Those vital business relationships mean index funds treat
their portfolio companies more like clients  Lund said in an interview
The problem is going to be greater as these index funds get more money
she said  The index fund firms say they take seriously the watchdog
role that institutional investors have historically played in the
stock market  Proxy voting  they say  is only a small part of their
regular engagement with companies  and they prefer to address problems
privately   Continuing to have a dialogue without airing all of our
dirty laundry  helps maintain long term relationships  said Glenn
Booraem  who oversees Vanguard s proxy voting and its interaction with
portfolio companies  BlackRock said it talks or emails with executives
and directors   sometimes for years   before voting against them   A
vote against management is a sign of a failed engagement   Michelle
Edkins  who oversees BlackRock s proxy voting  said in an interview
It s wrong to measure the effectiveness of BlackRock s investment
stewardship efforts solely by our proxy voting record   BlackRock said
in a statement   That fails to recognize our process of engaging
directly with companies to enhance the long term value of our clients
assets   BlackRock  State Street and Vanguard all declined requests to
discuss their votes on specific proxy proposals at poor performing
firms  or to provide details of their private interventions at laggard
companies  State Street declined to make executives available for
comment   We use our voice and vote to influence companies on long
term governance and sustainability issues   State Street spokeswoman
Olivia Offner said in an email  Proxy votes on proposals by the
company or its shareholders  influence key issues of executive pay
director appointments and strategic plans  along with a company s
actions to address controversial issues such as climate change or
gender pay equity  BlackRock opposed executive pay just 3  of the time
in 2018 at Russell 3000 companies and Vanguard opposed pay 5  of the
time  according to Proxy Insight  State Street funds did not support
pay 9  of the time in that group of companies  according to Proxy
Insight  The figure includes a small number of abstentions by State
Street  Compare that to America s largest public retirement funds  The
378 billion California Public Employees  Retirement System opposed
executive pay 53  of the time in the first seven months of 2019 at U S
companies  according to its latest report  The  210 billion New York
State Common Retirement Fund opposed executive pay packages 27  of the
time last year at U S  companies  a spokesman for the fund said  The
200 billion retirement system run by the Florida State Board of
Administration voted against executive compensation 64  of the time
among 2 226 U S  companies during the twelve months ended June 30
Jacob Williams  NYSE WMB   the system s corporate governance manager
told Reuters    For a graphic comparing how large index firms and
pension plans voted in 2018  see     Some activist investors cite the
low rate of negative votes by top investors as a reason for the
persistence of unpopular corporate practices  such as rich executive
compensation and poor disclosure of climate impacts  Median CEO pay
rose 25  to  12 1 million in 2018 from  9 7 million in 2014 at the 500
largest publicly traded U S  companies by revenue  according to the
latest disclosures analyzed by executive pay researcher Equilar
Company leaders usually won t even discuss an issue unless about a
third of investors cast opposing votes  said Tim Brennan  who until
June oversaw proxy votes and resolutions as chief financial officer
for the Unitarian Universalist Association   The votes definitely
matter   he said  CalPERS investment director Simiso Nzima said CEO
pay design would improve if other big investors voted more critically
Talking to companies behind the scenes on this particular issue is a
bit like trying to boil the ocean   Nzima said    EXCESSIVELY
DEFERENTIAL  Few foresaw an investing revolution when Jack Bogle of
Vanguard introduced the first index fund  now called the Vanguard 500
fund  N VOO   in 1976  Rather than trying to beat the market  Bogle
simply sought to match it   while chopping fees to investors  Bogle
who died in January  often recalled how early index funds were
disparaged as mediocre  even called  un American   After the 2008
financial crisis whipsawed retirement account balances  many investors
stopped trying to beat the market and embraced the lower fees of
passive funds  At the end of August  passive U S  stock funds managed
4 27 trillion   up from less than  1 trillion before the crisis  and
slightly more than the  4 25 trillion in actively managed U S  stock
funds  according to research firm Morningstar Inc   Challenging
company management in proxy votes creates adversarial relationships
that do not serve the business interests of the index funds  Lucian
Bebchuk  a Harvard University corporate governance scholar  wrote in a
May research paper  The index fund firms are  excessively deferential
to the managers of their portfolio companies  he wrote  because that
approach better serves their corporate mission to grow their assets
under management   and the fees that come with managing those assets
Bebchuk and several other academics say the index fund providers do
not want to rankle senior management at publicly traded U S
corporations because they also want to make money selling index funds
to their employees through company retirement plans  Effectively
monitoring the thousands of firms in stock market indexes would also
require considerable staff and resources with little tangible payoff
to an index fund s bottom line  Because the funds all own the same
stocks   under formulas calibrated to track a broad index   they can t
compete with one another on market performance  Instead  they compete
with aggressive discounting of fees   Those low costs are also the
biggest selling point of all index funds over their actively managed
competitors  which must charge more to pay for teams of managers who
constantly research companies and cull low performers from their
portfolios Index funds  business model and cost pressures don t allow

said in an interview   BlackRock  for instance  has 45 people on its
team that handles proxy votes  according to a company report in August
The votes cover about 16 000 corporate meetings per year  Last year
the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association  LACERA  moved
about  10 billion in equity index assets into accounts that would
allow the retirement plan to take over proxy voting   and take it away
from external portfolio managers including BlackRock  according to
publicly available meeting minutes  With expanded voting power  LACERA
s support for management proposals dropped to 80  in 2018 from 93  the
previous year  when BlackRock had more sway  according to LACERA board

EXECUTIVE PAY During the 2018 proxy season  top index fund providers
supported corporate leaders through some trying times for shareholders

three funds  backing of a big raise for PG E chief executive Geisha
Williams   to  8 6 million in 2018 from  4 2 million the year before
came after the company suspended its dividend  The executive pay
package received overwhelming support from other investors  even
though a stable dividend is a key reason for owning utility stocks  PG
E stock lost a quarter of its value in 2017  The utility sought
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year after severe
wildfires in 2017 and 2018 resulted in more than  30 billion in
liabilities amid investigations into whether the utility s equipment
had caused the blazes   When the index fund companies helped defeat
the proposal to split the chairman and CEO roles at GE in 2018  their
huge stakes in the company allowed them collectively to cast 1 3
billion votes against the measure out of a total of 2 8 billion votes
in opposition  Investors supporting the measure cast nearly 2 billion
votes in favor  hoping to curb the power of GE s CEO in the boardroom
In November 2017  the three index fund firms unanimously backed the
pay packages at beauty products company Coty Inc  N COTY   one of the
worst performers in the Russell 3000 index after losing 72  of its
value in the three years ended in 2018  The nearly  500 000 in tuition
payments for executives  children   an unusual perk   came as part of
pay packages that ranged from  3 million to  12 million  The Florida
State Board of Administration was one of the few dissenters to vote
against Coty s pay arrangements  The large index funds also backed the
re election of Coty Chairman Lambertus Becht  who received a special
3 6 million payout for his work on the company s  12 5 billion
acquisition of Procter   Gamble s beauty business in 2016  Top proxy
adviser Institutional Shareholder Services said Becht s total
compensation of  4 6 million  significantly exceeds market norms for
non employee director pay   Other major investors voted in favor of
Becht s re election  but some dumped Coty s stock as it struggled to
digest the acquisition  Spokespeople for PG E  General Electric and
Coty declined to comment for this story  It s rare in proxy voting for
a majority of investors in a company to oppose executive pay packages
Even in such cases  BlackRock usually supports management  In 2018
among the 57 companies in the Russell 3000 that failed to win a
majority of investor support for their pay plans  BlackRock sided with
management about 60  of the time  according to consulting firm Semler
Brossy and company voting records  BlackRock supported rich pay
packages for directors at Clovis Oncology  who each earned about  500
000 a year despite the firm s modest market capitalization of  1 4
billion  That s twice the typical pay of directors at the 500 largest
U S  companies by revenue  according to Equilar  Vanguard and State
Street sided against BlackRock  In all  58  of votes cast were against
a proposal to ratify director pay  Clovis  which declined to comment
responded by cutting director pay by one quarter after taking into
account the low support and investor feedback  the company said in its
2019 proxy   Switch  Inc  N SWCH  CEO Rob Roy received nearly  100
million in compensation in 2017 when he took the Las Vegas based data
center operator public  The following year  BlackRock backed the
election of three directors on Switch s compensation committee who had
awarded Roy his big pay package  State Street backed two of them
Vanguard voted against all three on the compensation committee   The
awards are unusual  and the complete lack of performance vesting
criteria heightens concern   proxy advisory firm ISS wrote in a May
2018 research report  Each of the three Switch directors received 97
of votes cast  Switch shares lost about two thirds of their value in
the 15 months after its October 2017 initial public offering  Switch
and CEO Roy declined to comment  ALL ABOARD FOR AN  84 MILLION PAYOUT
In one case  BlackRock noted concerns about a big payout to an
executive but voted for it anyway   In February 2017  legendary
railroad executive Hunter Harrison demanded  84 million in upfront
money to join CSX Corp  N CSX  as CEO  BlackRock balked at the size of
the payment and cited investor concerns about Harrison s health
according to a June 2017 BlackRock report on proxy voting  Before
investors voted on his pay package  a Wall Street Journal story
detailed how an undisclosed medical condition forced Harrison to work
from home  breathing with the help of an oxygen machine  BlackRock
which owned a 6  stake in the rail firm  put aside its concerns and
supported the pay package  which received 93  support from all
investors  Vanguard  with a 7  stake  and State Street  with around 4

died  CSX adopted a rule requiring its next CEO to submit to a

was filed by Virginia attorney John Fishwick Jr   and it was adopted
by the company before any vote  He said he was surprised none of the

14,Exclusive  Philips  under investigation in U S  and Brazil  fired whistleblower who warned of graft,"By Brad Brooks SAO PAULO  August 21  Reuters    Healthcare giant
Philips was warned of suspicious sales of its medical equipment to the
Brazilian government  and failed to halt them  nearly a decade before
an alleged bribery racket was exposed in the company s Brazil
operations last year  Reuters has learned  Claims of malfeasance
reached the highest levels of the Dutch conglomerate as early as 2010
according to court records filed by federal prosecutors  internal
company documents and Reuters interviews with a former manager at a
Philips subsidiary in Brazil who says he told superiors of the
suspected scheme and was later sacked  That ex employee  Jose Israel
Masiero Filho  a former supply chain executive with Dixtal Biomedica
Industria e Comercio Ltda   spoke extensively with Reuters in his
first interview with foreign media  He said in January 2010 he spotted
irregularities in three deals to sell Philips and Dixtal equipment to
an obscure Brazilian middleman who had landed big contracts with
Brazil s Ministry of Health  Masiero said he suspected payoffs had
been used to secure that government business  allegations now at the
heart of a burgeoning graft probe in Brazil  court records show
Masiero emailed an internal Philips hotline immediately to report his
suspicions  met soon after with the company s top compliance officer
and alerted at least three other senior executives during 2010  Among
them was Steve Rusckowski  former chief executive of Philips
Healthcare  the company s largest division  Masiero s warnings were
detailed in emails  internal company memos and court records viewed by
Reuters   Philips should consider that by approving and accepting
these sales  it will be involved in illegal activities if discovered
Masiero wrote to Rusckowski in an email dated October 14  2010  Still
Koninklijke Philips  AS PHG   as the company is formally known
continued to sell to the Brazilian intermediary to fulfill the Health
Ministry contracts  invoices show  Rusckowski  who served as Philips
Healthcare s chief executive until April 2012  did not respond to
requests for comment  He is now CEO of New Jersey based Quest
Diagnostics  N DGX   In an emailed statement to Reuters  Philips said
it is cooperating with Brazilian authorities investigating the nation
s medical device industry  The company said it launched an internal
investigation in 2010 in response to an  anonymous complaint  but  did
not identify direct evidence of wrongdoing   The company said it did
however  tighten up its internal control processes in Brazil  Philips
would not discuss ex employee Masiero or the circumstances surrounding
his dismissal  Brazil s Health Ministry did not respond to requests
for comment  HEALTHCARE IN THE CROSSHAIRS Philips is now among the
targets in a widening investigation into medical contracting graft in
Brazil that authorities say is still in its early stages  and which
has sparked additional probes by U S  law enforcement  Masiero is
cooperating with Brazilian prosecutors  They allege Philips and other
multinationals conspired with intermediaries to pay bribes for public
contracts  charging Brazil s state healthcare system inflated prices
to recoup the cost of the kickbacks  Twenty four people were charged
last year in connection with the alleged scheme  All are currently on
trial in Rio de Janeiro   Germany s  Siemens  AG  DE SIEGn  and the
American firms Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ    General Electric  Co  N GE
and  Stryker  Corp  N SYK   all major manufacturers of medical devices
have been swept up in the probe  Johnson   Johnson  Siemens and GE
declined to comment  They previously denied wrongdoing and said they
were cooperating with the investigation  Stryker said it was committed
to working in an ethical manner and that it was unable to comment
further  In the United States  the FBI  Department of Justice and the
Securities and Exchange Commission have launched their own
investigations into suspected corruption in sales of medical equipment
in Brazil as well as China  according to people with knowledge of the
matter  The whistleblower Masiero said he is cooperating with all
those agencies  an assertion confirmed in emails viewed by Reuters
The Justice Department  SEC and FBI all declined to comment  Philips
told Reuters it is  reviewing  inquiries from the Justice Department
and SEC in connection with the Brazil probe  MYSTERIOUS MIDDLEMAN Now
52  Masiero was hired in 2006 to be Dixtal s exports manager  rising
to become the top logistics and supply chain executive for the Sao
Paulo based medical device firm in early 2009  Philips purchased
Dixtal in 2008  In early 2010  Masiero noticed what he considered
irregularities with three large contracts awarded by Brazil s Health
Ministry  The deals  one for 750 Philips heart defibrillators  the
others for a total of 3 972 Dixtal vital signs monitors  were worth a
combined 68 9 million reis  about  40 million at the time   government
records show  Masiero said he found it odd that Philips did not
compete directly for such a major piece of business  Neither Philips
or Dixtal submitted bids  according to government records of tender
competitors viewed by Reuters  Instead the contracts were won by Rizzi
Comercio e Representacoes Ltda   a little known Brazilian medical
supply firm  Masiero  tasked with getting the equipment to Rizzi
Comercio  was surprised to find its billing address was a tiny
storefront with peeling purple paint in a dilapidated Sao Paulo
neighborhood   It was an immediate red flag for me   Masiero told
Reuters   In addition  the Health Ministry was paying well above
market prices for the equipment  Masiero said  unusual for a large
customer with buying clout  On February 12  2010  for example  Masiero
allegedly received an email from a Philips  sales executive  Frederik
Knudsen  directing him to deliver the first shipment of 60
defibrillators to Rizzi Comercio  which marked up those devices an
additional 67   according to correspondence included in court records
The value that should be on the order is what was agreed to with the
Health Ministry     16 700 per unit    and not what we sold them to
Rizzi for   9 991    according to the email allegedly from Knudsen
which was seen by Reuters  Prosecutors say Philips and Rizzi Comercio
conspired to disguise and recoup the cost of bribes through inflated
prices  fleecing Brazilian taxpayers in the process  Knudsen  whom
Philips confirmed still works for them  is now among those on trial in
Rio  So is Daurio Speranzini  who led Philips Healthcare s operations
in Latin America for seven years before joining GE in 2011  He left
that firm last December  Both men were charged last August with
racketeering and fraud  Knudsen s lawyers did not respond to requests
for comment  In a written defense filed with the court  they said
Knudsen did not set Philips  prices and that he is innocent  In a
separate court filing  they also questioned the veracity of the emails
their client allegedly sent to Masiero  Speranzini s lawyers referred
questions to their written defense  which contends he had no knowledge
of the alleged bribery scheme or of Masiero s warnings  Also on trial
for racketeering and fraud are two brothers who own Rizzi Comercio
Wlademir and Adalberto Rizzi  Their lawyer  who did not respond to
requests for comment  said in court filings that her clients engaged
in no illegal activities  SOUNDING THE ALARM Uneasy about the deals
with Rizzi Comercio  Masiero on January 20  2010  notified Philips
global compliance team in Amsterdam through an email hotline  Philips
sent Caroline Visser  then chief of Philips  global compliance  to
Brazil to meet with Masiero in March 2010  She promised a swift
investigation  according to emails the pair exchanged  Two months
later  Masiero was transferred from Dixtal to a logistics post within
Philips in Sao Paulo  a move he considered a demotion and an effort to
silence him  The shipments continued  invoices show  Frustrated
Masiero on October 14  2010  sent an email to Rusckowski  the head of
Philips  healthcare division  Masiero expressed concern about Rizzi
Comercio and its use of an unfamiliar intermediary  Moses Trading
American  to purchase the U S  made Philips heart defibrillators on
its behalf for export to Brazil  Far more typical  Masiero told
Reuters  would be for Philips to sell directly to Rizzi  Masiero s
uneasiness only increased when he traced Moses Trading American s
address on Philips  invoices to a private home on a golf course in
suburban Phoenix   Moses Trading selling operation is clearly
suspicious   Masiero wrote to Rusckowski  According to emails reviewed
by Reuters  Rusckowski forwarded Masiero s message to Clement Revetti
Jr   the chief legal officer for Philips Healthcare  Revetti thanked
Masiero and asked him not to contact the CEO again  Masiero defied
that order  On November 9  2010  he again emailed Rusckowski and
Revetti of his concerns  On March 4  2011  Masiero says he discussed
his suspicions once more in person in Sao Paulo with Visser  the
compliance head  He was fired later that day  Masiero said he was
given no reason for his dismissal  Paperwork required under Brazilian
labor laws shows Philips sacked Masiero  without cause   meaning the
company made no claims that it was performance related  Visser and
Revetti did not respond to requests for comment  As for Moses Trading
American  Brazilian prosecutors say that operation is run by a
Peruvian named Oscar Moses whom they are investigating in connection
with a string of allegedly fraudulent medical equipment deals in
Brazil  He has not been charged with a crime  Moses did not respond to
requests to comment sent to his LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  and Facebook

15,Dozens of Airbus A380s face urgent checks after cracked part dug from ice,"By Tim Hepher LONDON  Reuters    Investigators probing an engine
explosion on an Air France A380 in 2017 are studying a possible
manufacturing flaw in a recently salvaged cracked part in a move
likely to trigger urgent checks on dozens of Airbus superjumbos
people familiar with the matter said  The focus of a two year old
investigation into the mid air explosion over Greenland  which left
the plane carrying more than 500 passengers with the front of one
engine missing  has switched to the recently recovered  fan hub   the
people said  The titanium alloy part is the centerpiece of a 3 metre
wide fan on engines built for the world s largest airliner by U S
based Engine Alliance  co owned by  General Electric   N GE  and
United Technologies unit Pratt   Whitney  N UTX   It had sat buried in
Greenland s ice sheet since September 2017 when one of four engines on
Air France flight 66 abruptly disintegrated en route from Paris to Los
Angeles  It was prised from the ice in June after a high tech aerial
radar search  Confirming the focus of the probe after Reuters reported
the plans for inspections  France s BEA air accident agency said it
had discovered a  sub surface fatigue crack  on the recovered part and
the engine maker was preparing checks  The people familiar with the
matter linked the crack to a suspected manufacturing flaw and said the
checks   to be carried out urgently on engines that have conducted a
certain number of flights   would affect dozens of the double decker
jets  The people said the suspect part was fabricated on behalf of
consortium member Pratt   Whitney  which declined to comment   Engine
Alliance is one of two engine suppliers for the Airbus A380 in
competition with Britain s Rolls Royce  L RR   Its engines power a
total of 152 aircraft or just over 60 percent of the 237 A380s in
service  Besides Air France  other airlines operating the A380 with
Engine Alliance powerplants include Dubai s Emirates  Qatar Airways
Abu Dhabi based Etihad and Korean Air  The checks will involve taking
some planes out of service outside their usual maintenance schedules
one source said  Investigations are not complete and are likely to
tackle other features such as the loads or physical forces at play
Experts say air accidents are rarely caused by isolated factors
Europe s Airbus  PA AIR  declined to comment  SIOUX CITY REMEMBERED
Nobody was hurt in the September 2017 incident  in which the Air
France superjumbo diverted safely to Goose Bay in Canada   Although
rare  uncontained engine failures  in which shrapnel capable of
puncturing the fuselage exits an engine at extremely high speeds
automatically raise alarm  The checks come weeks after relatives
marked 30 years since an engine failure left a United Airlines DC 10
with almost no control  culminating in the death of 111 out of the 296
people on board during an attempted landing at Sioux City  Iowa  U S
investigators cited a defective titanium alloy part and weak
inspection procedures  although they also praised the  highly
commendable  performance of the crew of flight 232   The July 1989
crash sped up improvements in manufacturing methods for titanium alloy
Experts say hidden internal defects in such parts are unusual but
remain difficult to detect   Titanium alloy is used widely in
aerospace  which is the metal s biggest customer due to its strength
compared to the weight of each part and its ability to handle high
temperatures",2019-08-21,Reuters
16,General Electric wins partial dismissal of shareholder lawsuit,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK  Reuters    A federal judge in Manhattan on
Thursday partially dismissed a lawsuit by investors in  General
Electric   NYSE GE  Co that accused the company of concealing  24
billion in insurance liabilities and using fraudulent accounting to
prop up its power business  Judge Jesse Furman  however  granted the
shareholders permission to amend their complaint  The class action
lawsuit  originally filed in November 2017  consolidates six cases
that sought to hold GE and its senior leaders accountable for falling
profits in recent years   The suit  brought by more than a dozen U S
and foreign pension plans  retirement funds and investors in GE  names
the company and former Chief Executive Officers Jeff Immelt  John
Flannery and other senior executives  It alleges they understated GE s
exposure to long term care insurance risks and risks related to its
long term service agreements with customers that bought power plant
equipment from GE    Plaintiffs may be able to allege additional facts
regarding the individual defendants  knowledge  or conscious disregard
of  GE s actuarial issues  with respect to its LTC portfolio  and the
trends and risks it should have disclosed  with respect to its LTSAs
that would permit plaintiffs to clear the scienter bar   Furman wrote
in his ruling  referring to the legal term for knowledge of wrongdoing
In an emailed statement  a GE spokesman said   We are pleased the
court dismissed the vast majority of the claims against GE  including
the securities fraud allegations related to the company s legacy
insurance business  We intend to vigorously defend the rest of the
case and continue to believe the claims are without merit   The ruling
comes just after Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos said GE s
insurance business was under funded relative to what it owed for long
term care policies  A subsequent Fitch Ratings report ranked GE s
insurance units as among the most exposed to long term care and least
prepared to pay such claims   The suit alleges that starting in early
2013  Immelt and other top GE executives repeatedly misled investors
by saying GE had sold its insurance business even though GE remained
liable for money losing long term care policies   The insurance
policies  which cover the cost of assisted living or nursing care for
the elderly  have turned out to require much greater payouts from
insurers than was expected when the policies were written in the 1990s
and early 2000s   In January 2018  GE took a surprise  6 2 billion
after tax charge and began setting aside  15 billion to cover future
claims from about 300 000 long term care policies   GE has denied
using fraudulent accounting to hide falling sales and profits at its
power unit  It said investors were victims of  business setbacks and
forecasting misses  that GE disclosed at the time  GE also said the
suit failed to point out specific information it should have provided
that a reasonable investor would need to avoid being misled",2019-08-29,Reuters
17,General Electric fortifies defense against charges of bogus accounting,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK  Reuters     General Electric   NYSE GE  Co
reinforced its defense of its accounting practices on Monday after
investors asked more questions about an unusual research report last
week that accused the jet engine and power plant maker of financial
fraud  The 175 page report   published on Thursday by Harry Markopolos
who blew the whistle on Bernard Madoff s Ponzi scheme  renewed concern
about GE s finances and sent its stock tumbling   Some of  the
questions I ve been receiving go straight to the heart of GE s culture
so let me be clear  we operate with absolute integrity and stand
behind our financial reporting   Steve Winoker  GE s investor
relations chief  said in a statement on Monday  Investors are nervous
about GE because the Boston based conglomerate is expected to lose as
much as  1 billion in cash this year  has slashed its dividend and
profit forecast and taken more than  40 billion in charges and write
offs in recent years  Among the biggest shocks to investors  GE said
in 2017 that it would set aside  15 billion for long term care
insurance payouts  one of the largest such amounts ever  GRAPHIC  GE s
Long Term Plan    Markopolos said GE would need to put aside an
additional  29 billion for insurance losses  and that it had
improperly counted profit from oil and gas services subsidiary Baker
Hughes  A Reuters article in March found that GE s reserves were then
in line with other insurers  but some experts said GE would need to
set aside  12 billion more because its estimates relied on optimistic
assumptions  GE s shares fell as much as 15  after Markopolos  report
came out  recouping much of the decline on Friday  On Monday  GE
shares were down 1 4  at  8 67 in afternoon trading  In response to
the concerns about insurance  Winoker said on Monday that the amount
of GE s long term care payouts would be determined  over decades  not
years   and that GE uses  rigorous testing    sound actuarial analysis
and follows  regulatory and accounting  rules  Addressing the Baker
Hughes questions  Winoker said accounting rules require GE to include
the subsidiary s results in its earnings reports because it is the
majority shareholder  GE disclosed in 2018 that its accounting was
being investigated by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Department of Justice  It also is the subject of a class action
shareholder lawsuit that alleges fraud in GE s insurance and other
accounting  Winoker  who covered GE as an analyst at UBS before taking
his current job in January  said investors  questions about Markopolos
report prompted GE to comment on Monday  but did not say how many
questions GE received or characterize them  SHORT PROFITS Markopolos
said in the report that he stood to share in profits from a hedge fund
that sold GE shares short before the report came out  a bet that the
share price would fall  Short sales of GE shares rose by about  995
million in the month before Markopolos  report came out  according to
S3 Partners  a New York financial analytics firm  GE Chief Executive
Officer Larry Culp said last week that Markopolos  report was  market
manipulation   pure and simple    a reference to Markopolos  potential
to profit from short selling timed to the report  Culp and Leslie
Seidman  chair of GE s audit committee  said Markopolos did not talk
with GE before issuing his report  GE said Culp  Seidman and other GE
directors and executives bought shares after the report came out  GE
said in the statement on Monday that it has not under provisioned for
long term care insurance  which pays for assisted living and nursing
home care for policy holders  Such policies have pushed some insurers
into financial trouble  and even bankruptcy  because the costs have
turned out to be much higher than were assumed when the policies were
written in the late 1990s and early 2000s  GE is now only a reinsurer
of such coverage and says it has not written new long term care
policies since 2006  Markopolos  report said GE needs to add  18 5
billion to reserves now because it has underestimated its potential
claims  and will need to add a further  10 5 billion when new
accounting rules take effect in 2021 or 2022  Regarding Baker Hughes
GE said on Monday that the company s assets and income are correctly
included in GE s financial reports because GE owns 50 2   down from 50
4  last year  Markopolos said GE is double counting because it does
not in practice direct activities at Baker Hughes",2019-08-19,Reuters
18,General Electric insurance called  risky  by Fitch  shares fall again,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK  Reuters     General Electric  Co  N GE  ranks
among the riskiest backers of long term care insurance  suffering from
both high exposure to claims and a relatively small cash pile to pay
them  Fitch Ratings said in a report on Tuesday that sent GE s shares
tumbling  The Fitch report  which the credit rating agency produces
annually  echoed concerns raised last week by financial investigator
Harry Markopolos  who estimated that GE has under reserved by  29
billion for its long term care policies  GE stepped up its defense of
its insurance accounting on Monday  On Tuesday  the U S  conglomerate
reiterated comments it made on Monday  in response to the Markopolos
report   Our current reserves are well supported for our long term
care portfolio characteristics   GE said  It provided details about
how it set key assumptions used in determining its level of reserves
GE shares were down more than 3  at  8 40  The reports by Markopolos
and Fitch reignite debate about whether GE has set aside enough money
to cover its long term care liabilities or will need to put up many
billions more  potentially upending its plan to strengthen its fragile
finances   To deal with GE s debt load of  105 billion and low cash
inflow  Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp is selling businesses to
pay down debt  Analysts said any money diverted to reserves could
constrict how much Culp could cut GE s debt  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS
said on Monday that its analysis showed GE s reserves were likely
adequate   We continue to view GE s block as having high reserves on a
relative basis to peers   Goldman wrote  In March  Reuters similarly
found GE s reserves were in line with comparable insurers  But others
said long term policies differ significantly in benefits and costs to
insurers  In general  long term care coverage  which pays for assisted
living and nursing home stays  has turned out to be far more expensive
than insurers assumed when they sold policies decades ago  and has
tipped some insurers into financial loss and even bankruptcy  Fitch
said its analysis found GE and many other insurers still have not set
aside enough money to cover losses expected on long term care policies
which are unusually risky because the costs are volatile and
vulnerable to interest rate changes  Even insurers that have taken a
more conservative stance and set aside more money than GE have not
avoided losses  Fitch said  HIGH EXPOSURE But GE also has  very high
exposure to long term care for more than 250 000 retirees and others
who receive benefits paid for by such policies  Fitch Ratings analyst
Anthony Beato told Reuters   GE ranked second on Fitch s list of the
16 riskiest long term care insurers  just below Genworth Financial Inc
N GNW   a company that GE spun out in 2004  The other insurers cited
as having below average reserves and very high exposure are  Unum
Group   N UNM  and Senior Health Insurance Co of Pennsylvania  Fitch
said  In a statement  Genworth said its believes its reserve setting
process is appropriate and that it strong disagrees with Fitch s view
that its assumptions about future premium increases are too optimistic
Unum did not comment on the content of the Fitch report  Senior Health
did not respond to requests for comment  GE scored high  Beato said
because it has mostly older policies written when the costs of long
term care were poorly understood  A large portion of GE s policies
also provide lifetime benefits and some contain inflation protection
benefits   When you compound all of that together   GE s portfolio
looks much riskier than what the rest of the industry maintains
Beato said  GE s insurance group also has only about  1 billion in
capital on a statutory accounting basis  Beato said  While GE  as the
parent  has put in money to shore up reserves in the past  Fitch did
not factor that into its rankings because it wanted a comparison of
reported statutory capital levels across the industry  Beato said
Should GE have to increase reserves further  the capital base
continues to be dwarfed by this very large exposure  at GE s insurance
operating subsidiary  Beato said  Last week  GE audit committee
chairwoman Leslie Seidman said Markopolos  analysis was not accurate
I m not sure  he  really understands the accounting in this area   she
said in an interview on CNBC    GE did not make those comments about
Fitch s report on Tuesday  but said it stood by its own accounting",2019-08-20,Reuters

22,U S  oil drillers cut rigs for second week in a row  Baker Hughes," Reuters    U S  energy firms this week reduced the number of oil rigs
operating for a second week in a row as drillers follow through on
plans to cut spending this year  Drillers cut four oil rigs in the
week to July 12  bringing the total count down to 784  the lowest
since February 2018   General Electric  Co s  N GE  Baker Hughes
energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday
That compares with 863 rigs operating during the same week a year ago
More than half the total U S  oil rigs are in the Permian basin in
West Texas and eastern New Mexico  where active units decreased by six
this week to 437  the lowest since March 2018  The Permian is the
biggest U S  shale oil play  The rig count  an early indicator of
future output  has declined over the past seven months as independent
exploration and production companies cut spending on new drilling as
they focus more on earnings growth instead of increased output   Most
of the change in the weekly rig count was due to drops in both
directional and vertical drilling activities   said Trey Cowan  Senior
Analyst  S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts Analytics in an email   Since
directional and vertical wells are typically shallower drilling
endeavors that generally take less time from spud to release  the drop
in these counts after the U S   Fourth of July  holiday may prove to
be more noise than a signal of things to come   he said  For the year
the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  projects U S  crude
output will rise to 12 36 million barrels per day  bpd  in 2019  up
from the annual record of 10 96 million bpd set in 2018   Surging U S
oil output will outpace sluggish global demand and lead to a large
stocks build around the world in the next nine months  the
International Energy Agency  IEA  said on Friday  U S  crude futures
CLc1  traded around  60 per barrel on Friday  putting the contract on
track to rise about 5  after slipping almost 2  in the previous week

output because of a tropical storm and as tensions continued to simmer
in the Middle East   Looking ahead  crude futures were trading around
60 a barrel for the balance of 2019  and  58 in calendar 2020   U S

from the exploration and production  E P  companies it tracks point to
a 5  decline in capital expenditures for drilling and completions in
2019 versus 2018  Cowen said independent producers expect to spend
about 11  less in 2019  while major oil companies plan to spend about

23,Wall Street takes on long term care payouts as insurers balk at costs,"By David French NEW YORK  Reuters    Some U S  insurers are turning to
Wall Street s financial wizards for relief from the liabilities of
their long term care  LTC  policies  posing a challenge for regulators
worried about how new industry players will tackle the risks involved
These policies help support the provision of care to those unable to
handle everyday tasks  such as bathing and cooking  by funding
assisted living or nursing home arrangements  Many have become
financially toxic for insurers  because of soaring healthcare costs
and rising lifespans  A few investment firms are willing to take on
these LTC contracts  betting they can invest the premiums from the
policies to generate strong enough returns to cover the payouts  and
even turn a tidy profit  While these transactions promise financial
relief to insurers  they are not without risk  The LTC liabilities can
be big enough to weigh on even conglomerates such as  General Electric
NYSE GE  Co  If the premiums from the assumed LTC contracts are
invested poorly  there may be insufficient money to cover the payouts
industry experts say   Some of those deals include nontraditional
actors  which we question with regard to their expertise associated
with the management of these liabilities  as well as the very
aggressive reserving and cash flow assumptions   said Anthony Beato  a
director at credit ratings agency Fitch Ratings  Those at the
forefront of state insurance regulation paint a picture of the
industry s watchdogs attempting to walk a fine line between the need
to alleviate financial pressure on insurers and policing risky deals
There is a trend toward encouragement to make sure there is a
functioning private LTC insurance market to cope with the baby boomers
needs   Fred Andersen  chief life actuary at Minnesota s Department of
Commerce  said of the general regulatory attitude toward these deals
At stake is the viability of the LTC policies on which elderly and
disabled people rely  Without private insurance  they would be forced
to pay for their own care or rely on already stretched state and
federal programs such as Medicaid  Around 12 million people in the
United States will need such assistance by the end of this decade
according to the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  This
figure is set to skyrocket as the number of retirees increases
Americans over 65 years old are projected to more than double to 98
million by 2060  The LTC market has already shrunk because of the
financial strain facing insurers  Fewer than 70 000 new LTC policies
were written in the United States in 2017  down from 372 000 in 2004
according to the most recent data from the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners  NAIC   The average annual LTC policy premium
rose to  2 772 in 2015 from  1 677 in 2000  based on NAIC data
Graphic  How insurers are managing the risks of long term care plans
POLICIES CHANGE HANDS Two major LTC transactions took place in the
last 12 months  and insurance executives and dealmakers say they
expect more to happen this year  Continental General Insurance Company
CGIC   a subsidiary of hedge fund veteran Philip Falcone s HC2
Holdings Inc  completed the purchase of health insurer Humana  NYSE
HUM  Inc s  2 4 billion LTC business last August  It was the second
such deal for CGIC  which also acquired the LTC business of American
Financial Group Inc in 2015  In September  Wilton Re  which is owned
by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board  reinsured the LTC
policies of CNO Financial Group Inc  This meant that CNO continued to
administer the policies  but Wilton Re took over the investment of the
premiums and guaranteed the payouts  Humana and CNO had to pay the
financial firms  203 million and  825 million  respectively  to get
the LTC portfolios off their books  Analysts say such one off charges
are better for insurers than allowing LTC policies to drain their
finances  Fitch said in a report last October that many U S  insurers
with LTC portfolios would need to allocate at least 10  more cash to
reserves covering these policies in 2019  Prudential Financial Inc
NYSE PRU  and  Unum Group   NYSE UNM  were among the insurance firms
that announced in 2018 they needed to commit extra cash to fund future
LTC liabilities  One insurer  Penn Treaty  collapsed in 2017 under the
weight of its LTC obligations  General Electric  which said last year
it would take a  6 2 billion after tax charge and set aside a further
15 billion in reserves to help cover its LTC liabilities  is also
looking for a buyer for its LTC portfolio  Reuters has reported  RISKY
BETS CNO s first attempt to seek relief from its LTC portfolio soured
in 2016 following a reinsurance deal with Beechwood Re  which was
founded by two Wall Street veterans  Beechwood subsequently collapsed
after investing some of the policy premiums in Platinum Partners  a
hedge fund that folded due to its risky bets and whose top executives
were indicted in a U S  federal fraud probe in December 2016  As a
result  CNO was forced to reabsorb the  550 million LTC portfolio and
take a  53 million after tax charge  U S  state regulators tasked with
averting such failed deals are generally more focused on the reserves
the investment firms set aside  rather than how they invest the
premiums from the LTC policies  said Ann Frohman  founder of Frohman
Law Office and a former head of Nebraska s Department of Insurance
In addition to current requirements  one area of improvement would be
having all states require the stress testing of investment assumptions
on LTC portfolios against financial crisis type economic conditions
Frohman said  Some firms taking on the LTC portfolios also invest in
junk rated corporate credit  which is more susceptible to losses
during an economic downturn  according to Fitch s Beato  Wilton Re
declined to comment on how it invests LTC policy premiums  while a
CGIC spokesman said it focuses on generating higher yields from
investment grade assets  Even if some insurers do not place risky
investment bets  regulators say they also have to watch out for firms
seeking to avoid paying out some claims to boost their profitability
That is always a concern   said Pennsylvania s insurance commissioner
Jessica Altman",2019-06-19,Reuters
24,General Electric to scrap California power plant 20 years early,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK  Reuters     General Electric   NYSE GE  Co
said on Friday it plans to demolish a large power plant it owns in
California this year after only one third of its useful life because
the plant is no longer economically viable in a state where wind and
solar supply a growing share of inexpensive electricity  The 750
megawatt natural gas fired plant  known as the Inland Empire Energy
Center  uses two of GE s H Class turbines  developed only in the last
decade  before the company s successor gas turbine  the flagship HA
model  which uses different technology  The closure illustrates stiff
competition in the deregulated energy market as cheap wind and solar
supply more electricity  squeezing out fossil fuels  Some utilities
say they have no plans to build more fossil plants  It also highlights
the stumbles of Boston based GE with its first H Class turbine  The
complex  steam cooled H design takes hours to start  suffered
technical problems and sold poorly  experts said   We have made the
decision to shut down operation of the Inland Empire Power Plant
which has been operating below capacity for several years  effective
at the end of 2019   GE told Reuters  The plant  is powered by a
legacy gas turbine technology     and is uneconomical to support
further   GE declined to comment on whether it would take a charge for
shutting the plant  GE operates few power plants of its own  In a
filing with the California Energy Commission on Thursday  GE said the
plant is  not designed for the needs of the evolving California market
which requires fast start capabilities to satisfy peak demand periods
GE s newer HA turbine can power up in under an hour  more quickly than
the H to match fluctuating supplies of wind and solar power  GE said
The large market for the H turbine that GE anticipated  did not
develop and has resulted in an orphan technology installation at IEEC
the filing said  It added that GE will no longer support or make
replacement parts for the H turbine  Only one other plant uses H
turbines  Baglan Bay in Wales  California approved the Inland Energy
Center  located in Riverside County  about 75 miles  120 7 km  east of
Los Angeles  in 2003 and the plant opened in 2009  Industry experts
estimated it cost nearly  1 billion  Similar combined cycle gas power
plants run for 30 years before being decommissioned  according to a
recent study by S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Market Intelligence  One of the
two Inland Empire turbines was mothballed in 2017  cutting the plant s
output to about 376 megawatts  according to the filing and the
California Independent System Operator  which oversees the state s
electricity grid  Closing the plant will eliminate about 23 jobs  the
filing said  GE has been promoting its  H Class  turbines amid a
severe downturn in demand for fossil fuel power plants  The two  H
turbines being demolished in California differ from GE s current HA
which uses air cooling  said a former GE engineer familiar with both
turbine types  Still  premature closure of a turbine marketed as  H
Class  is a negative for GE as it struggles to restore profits at its
power business  the expert noted  Power  once GE s largest division
lost  22 8 billion last year as the company grapples with slack demand
for fossil fuel plants  The company is set to lose up to  2 billion in

WASHINGTON  Reuters     General Electric   NYSE GE  Co potentially
stands to win a large share of multibillion dollar contracts to
rebuild Iraq s electricity system  reflecting a change in how Iraq
intends to award the work after the United States lobbied for GE
according to sources familiar with the matter  Iraq signed five year
roadmap  agreements with GE and  Siemens  AG  DE SIEGn  last October
under which the country plans to spend about  14 billion on new plants
repairs  power lines and  eventually  equipment to capture for use
natural gas that is now being flared off  In awarding projects to
Siemens in April  however  Iraq s prime minister said the German
company was well placed to win the bulk of future deals  But sources
familiar with all three sides of the matter told Reuters that  under U
S  prodding  Iraq is asking both Siemens and GE to bid on contracts
and expects to make awards to each of the companies   Political
pressures on the Iraqi government     pushed the Abadi government to
change plans and allow GE to get on board   an Iraqi electricity
ministry official with knowledge of GE and Siemens activities in Iraq
told Reuters  referring to former Prime Minister Haider al Abadi   It
was obvious for us the U S  government was not happy with Siemens
taking over the megadeal alone without any chance for GE   the
official said   Talks are underway to decide about mid  and long term
contracts  which we expect to be divided between them   Iraq s
electricity ministry did not respond to requests for comment  A U S
State Department official confirmed that the U S  pressed Iraq in GE s
behalf   Harnessing the innovative capabilities of U S  companies like
GE is an essential component of our strategy to expand economic ties
and increase foreign investment to help Iraq rebuild   the official
said  The sources  who spoke on condition of anonymity  said Iraq will
be awarding contracts in three phases over the next four years   It is
not one winner takes all   said one of the sources   It s an ongoing
process that you have to work at every level   Siemens and GE have
supplied generation plants and other electrical equipment to Iraq for
decades  Many of these assets need to be refurbished and upgraded
after years of war  creating substantial scope for work by both
companies  Since October  GE has signed agreements to upgrade
maintain and rebuild facilities to boost generation capacity by 5 000
megawatts  according to sources familiar with the situation  The
Boston based conglomerate also included as part of the October roadmap
two 750 megawatt plants Iraq ordered in 2017  the sources said  A GE
spokesperson said  Iraq and GE are in productive discussions to
strengthen the country s power sector   Last month  a 125 megawatt GE
9E turbine went online at Iraq s Al Qudus power plant  GE said
Siemens said it took  one first major step toward the actual
implementation of the roadmap  when it signed an agreement with Iraq
on April 30 that lays out projects  budgets and timelines  The April
agreement includes three contracts worth about 700 million euros for a
new 500 megawatt power plant  upgrades to 40 gas turbines and new
substations  Iraq is one of the few bright spots in a shrinking global
market for fossil fuel power plants and equipment  The country s peak
power needs outstrip its generation capacity by one third  and the gap
is expected to widen as Iraq s economy grows  the International Energy
Agency said in April    Difficulty working in the war torn country and
the uncertainty about Iraq s funding likely will limit the payoff for
the companies  two industry experts said  But new orders are vital for
Siemens and GE  which are both cutting capacity in response to a steep
drop in orders for large turbines",2019-06-14,Reuters

28,French demands challenge FCA Renault deal push,"By Laurence Frost and Giulio Piovaccari PARIS MILAN  Reuters    Talks
on Fiat Chrysler s proposed merger with  Renault   PA RENA  became
mired in politics on Monday  as France sought more concessions to
maintain government influence over the new carmaker s management and
French assets  sources told Reuters  Italian American FCA is in
negotiations with Renault and its biggest shareholder  France  over
the  35 billion merger proposal it pitched last week to create the
world s third biggest carmaker  France  which owns 15  of Renault  has
broadly welcomed the deal on condition it safeguards domestic jobs and
plants   but political sensitivities have only increased as talks
progress  John Elkann  scion of the Agnelli family whose Exor holding
controls FCA via a 29  stake  has sought to placate the French and
Italian governments  while also keeping shareholders including Renault
s alliance partner Nissan on board  The FCA proposal would see both
carmakers acquired by a listed Dutch holding company owned 50 50 by
current FCA and Renault shareholders  after payment of a 2 5 billion
euro   2 8 billion  special dividend to FCA shareholders  Responding
to criticism from some analysts and French industry leaders that the
deal undervalued Renault and its 43 4  stake in Nissan  Paris pushed
for better terms  The approach bore fruit over the weekend  as FCA
discussed a Renault dividend and stronger job guarantees among
concessions designed to secure France s support  They include a Paris
headquarters for the combined carmaker s Europe  Middle East and
Africa region and its global chief executive  current Renault Chairman
Jean Dominique Senard  as well as a seat on the board for the French
state  people with knowledge of the matter said  As the two sides
appeared to be converging on a deal  with the Renault board meeting on
Tuesday  President Emmanuel Macron s government upped its demands  two
people close to the negotiations said  The government is now pushing
for a significant board presence on the French subsidiary that would
oversee Renault assets and plants  the sources said   as well as an
effective veto on future CEO appointments after Senard  who is 66
French officials want to be able to ensure that the job guarantees and
merger of equals  philosophy underpinning the deal are respected

government all declined to comment on the ongoing negotiations  As
officials  bankers and lawyers were absorbed in what may be a final
deal push  Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire was jeered on Monday by
some of the 1 044 former  Alstom   PA ALSO  workers being laid off by
General Electric   NYSE GE    which had promised to safeguard their
jobs when it acquired the business in 2015  along with their plant in
Belfort  eastern France   It s understandable that the French
government is pushing here and there  but FCA probably isn t ready to
re open the whole deal   one source close to the tie up talks said

may start to fall apart   In Italy  where the government has

Commission is investigating  Siemens  AG  DE SIEGn   Philips NV and
General Electric   NYSE GE  Co for allegedly using local middlemen to
negotiate bribes with Chinese government and hospital officials to
sell medical equipment  two U S  sources with knowledge of the matter
told Reuters  The investigations into the companies  business in China
along with an existing SEC probe into their sales in Brazil  are part
of a new effort by U S  regulators to crack down on alleged corruption
in sales of costly medical equipment worldwide  said the sources  who
spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to
discuss the investigation publicly   The SEC declined to comment
Siemens  GE and Philips all denied wrongdoing and said they were
unaware of any SEC investigation concerning their operations in China
Reuters reported in May that the SEC  along with the U S  Justice
Department and FBI  were investigating Siemens  GE and Philips   as
well as Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ    for allegedly paying bribes to
win contracts in Brazil  The four companies all denied any wrongdoing
in Brazil  Under a U S  federal law called the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977  FCPA   it is illegal for Americans  U S
companies or foreign companies whose securities are listed in the
United States to pay foreign officials to win business  If found
guilty of violating the act  firms could face fines from the SEC
China s medical device market stood at  58 63 billion in 2017
compared to  10 8 billion for Brazil   according to the most recent
data available from the U S  Commerce Department   In both markets
the companies benefited not only from the sale of the equipment but
also from the bigger profit margins to be made on servicing it during
its 10 to 15 year lifespan as well as selling software updates  spare
parts and the materials used in operating the machines  the sources
said   China s National Health and Family Planning Commission and the
China Food and Drug Administration  which regulate the healthcare
system  did not immediately respond to requests for comment  Brazilian
federal prosecutors declined to comment  INVESTOR LAWSUIT Some details
of the alleged scheme in China were included in a shareholder lawsuit
against current and former members of GE s board in New York state
court  which the company disclosed in its 2018 annual report   The GE
shareholder lawsuit  filed in New York state Supreme Court last
December  alleges that since at least 2011 GE employees in China or
workers at its subsidiaries  have bribed hospital administrators
engaged in collusive bidding  and given kickbacks to government
officials   The lawsuit includes translations of Chinese criminal
court rulings finding middlemen who sold GE equipment guilty of
bribing Chinese government and hospital officials  Some hospital
administrators confessed in open court and received prison sentences
according to rulings cited in the lawsuit  GE was not charged in the
Chinese court rulings included as evidence  The lawsuit accuses GE of
colluding with Philips  Siemens and Toshiba Corp s medical unit
which was bought by Canon Inc in 2016   to fix prices and rig tenders
for expensive medical equipment  such as MRI machines and CT scanners
through Chinese middlemen  The lawsuit included public data on how
much Chinese hospitals paid for the equipment  which it said was
routinely at least 40 percent above the price the middlemen paid to
the companies  The difference was then distributed as bribes to health
officials  the lawsuit alleges  with some money being pocketed by the
middlemen and flowing back to the other companies  who allegedly put
in  cover  bids to make the public tender appear competitive  Lawyers
for GE in February filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit  saying the
complaint failed to link alleged wrongdoing in China to any of the
defendants  The judge in the case has not yet ruled on the motion
Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not respond to emailed requests for
comment   Boston based GE said in an emailed statement that it
believes the lawsuit lacks merit  adding that  we are committed to
integrity  compliance and the rule of law in every country in which we
do business   Amsterdam based Philips said in an emailed statement it
is  fully complying with local and international anti bribery and anti
corruption laws   Philips said it was  not involved  in any of the
transactions in the criminal cases in China and that it makes
extensive efforts to ensure its third party agents act lawfully
Siemens said in an emailed statement that it had just become aware of
the New York lawsuit and it would  investigate any new allegation of
misconduct that directly or indirectly involves Siemens  that may
arise from the litigation  Siemens  based in Munich  said that its
policy is  to cooperate with law enforcement investigations when they
occur   Canon said in an emailed statement that  Canon Medical Systems
Group are committed to conducting business activities with the highest
priority on compliance with laws  and that the company has a zero
tolerance toward bribery  Toshiba said in an emailed statement that it
was not aware of the New York state lawsuit  It said company policies

was battling to defend its business strategy on Thursday after being
blamed for scuppering a  35 billion plus merger between carmakers Fiat
Chrysler  FCA  and  Renault   PA RENA  only 10 days after the plan was
officially announced  Shares in Italian American FCA and France s
Renault fell sharply in early trade after FCA pulled out of talks
saying  the political conditions in France do not currently exist for
such a combination to proceed successfully   The collapse of the deal
which would have created the world s third biggest carmaker behind
Japan s Toyota and Germany s Volkswagen  DE VOWG p   revives questions
about how both FCA and Renault will meet the challenges of costly
investments in electric and self driving cars on their own   The
French government  which has a 15  stake in Renault  had welcomed the
merger plan  but overplayed its hand by pushing for a series of
guarantees and concessions that eventually exhausted the patience of
FCA  sources familiar with the talks said   Wrong footed by FCA s
decision to withdraw its merger proposal late on Wednesday  a French
official called FCA Chairman John Elkann early on Thursday to see if
he might reconsider  but was rebuffed  one of the sources said   While
France has a long history of government interference in business
President Emmanuel Macron came to power promising a broadly market
friendly agenda  The failure of the FCA deal risks leaving Renault
locked into Europe s stagnant mass market for cars  and deterring
other potential suitors  analysts said  NISSAN FACTOR French finance
minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday the government had engaged
constructively  but had not been prepared to back a deal without the
endorsement of Renault s current alliance partner Nissan  Nissan had
said it would abstain at a Renault board meeting to vote on the merger
proposal  The merger had aimed to achieve 5 billion euros   5 6
billion  in annual synergies  with FCA gaining access to Renault s
superior electric drive technology and the French firm getting a share
of FCA s lucrative Jeep and RAM brands   Achieving the planned 5
billion euros in FCA Renault synergies would depend partly on access
to technology jointly owned by Nissan  executives had said  However  a
source close to FCA played down the significance of Nissan s stance in
the discussions and blamed the French government for succumbing to
political pressure at home   The FCA Renault talks were conducted
against the backdrop of a French public outcry over 1 044 layoffs at a
General Electric   NYSE GE  factory  The U S  company had promised to
safeguard jobs there when it acquired France s  Alstom   PA ALSO  in
2015  FCA has long been looking for a merger partner  and some
analysts say its search for a deal is becoming more urgent as it is
ill prepared for tougher new regulations on emissions  It previously
held unsuccessful talks with Peugeot maker PSA Group  in which the
French state also owns a stake   We remain open to any industrial
consolidation opportunity  but without rushing in order to guarantee
the industrial interests of Renault and the French nation   Le Maire
told the Senate in a weekly government questions session  However
Evercore ISI analysts said the chances of a deal with FCA had
materially fallen   Renault said in a statement it was disappointed
not to be able to pursue the merger  but that FCA s interest
highlighted the attractiveness of the company and its alliance with
Nissan   BLAME GAME The collapse of the deal could further fray
relations between Renault and Nissan  already strained by the arrest
and ouster of alliance chairman Carlos Ghosn  who is now facing trial
in Japan on financial misconduct charges he denies  Nissan  which is
43  owned by Renault and has recently rebuffed a full merger proposal
from its French partner  was blindsided by the FCA Renault tie up plan
and said it would require a fundamental review of its relationship
with Renault   How can we support the deal   said a Nissan management
source soon before the talks collapsed   We weren t at the table  so
we haven t had time to evaluate its impact on Nissan and the alliance
The deal s failure could also add to financial markets  frustration
with France    With FCA pulling its merger offer  one has to wonder
how much the French state is set on limiting Renault s strategic and
valuation opportunities despite having only a 15  stake   analysts at
brokerage Jefferies wrote in a note to clients  At 1450 GMT  Renault
shares were down 7 1  at 52 19 euros  while FCA shares in Milan had
recovered most of their early losses to trade down 0 1  at 11 61 euros
Nissan shares had earlier closed down 1 7   PSA shares  meanwhile
were up 1 9   as some analysts speculated it could again be targeted
by FCA   But one banker who has worked on several FCA and car industry
deals in the past said   There are few alternatives available for FCA
I think they ll try again with Renault   The collapse of the FCA
Renault deal also followed days of bickering between France and Italy
over Paris s demands     When politicians try to intervene in economic
matters  it doesn t always help  I won t comment further  if FCA

investigating corporate giants Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ    Siemens
AG  DE SIEGn    General Electric   NYSE GE  Co and Philips for
allegedly paying kickbacks as part of a scheme involving medical
equipment sales in Brazil  two Brazilian investigators have told
Reuters  Brazilian prosecutors suspect the companies channeled illegal
payoffs to government officials to secure contracts with public health
programs across the South American country over the past two decades
Brazilian authorities say more than 20 companies may have been part of
a  cartel  that paid bribes and charged the government inflated prices
for medical gear such as magnetic resonance imaging machines and
prosthetics   The four multinational companies  with a combined market
capitalization of nearly  600 billion at Thursday s market close  are
the largest foreign enterprises to be investigated in an unprecedented
anti corruption push in Brazil in recent years  Big U S  and European
companies found to have engaged in wrongdoing in Brazil could also
face heavy fines and other punishment under the U S  Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act  FCPA   Since 1977  that law has made it illegal for
American citizens  U S  companies or foreign companies whose
securities are listed in the United States to pay foreign officials to
win business   Foreign companies are the latest targets of government
corruption probes in Brazil  Over the past five years  prosecutors
have uncovered pervasive graft in state institutions and private
sector companies seeking to do business with them   The sprawling
investigations by prosecutors and federal police  including the famed
Car Wash  dragnet centered on Brazil s state run oil company Petrobras
have toppled business and political leaders across Latin America
Authorities say plea bargain testimonies obtained from suspects
alerted them to other possible schemes  including alleged bribes paid
by multinationals to obtain public contracts in Brazil    CONSTANTLY
SHARING   Brazilian federal prosecutor Marisa Ferrari  NYSE RACE
confirmed in an interview with Reuters that U S  authorities from the
Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission were
assisting in the Brazilian medical equipment investigation she helps
lead   In 2016  U S  and Brazilian prosecutors jointly negotiated the
world s largest ever compliance penalty  a  3 5 billion fine against
Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht SA for its part in the
Car Wash scandal    We are constantly sharing information with the FBI
on this  medical equipment  case  They ask for documents and we send
them  and they are assisting our investigation in return   Ferrari
said  In addition  she said   We ve received a lot of material from
the Department of Justice and from the SEC    She declined to name
which companies U S  law enforcement agencies were investigating  Two
Brazilian investigators with direct knowledge of the matter confirmed
to Reuters that Johnson   Johnson  Siemens  GE  and Koninklijke
Philips NV were being targeted by the FBI for alleged bribery in
Brazil  The people requested anonymity because they were not
authorized to discuss the U S  side of the investigation   The FBI
would not confirm or deny the existence of any investigations  The SEC
which also investigates FCPA allegations  said by email that it
declined to comment   Boston based GE declined to comment on any
investigation related to its business in Brazil  It said in an emailed
statement   We are committed to integrity  compliance and the rule of
law in Brazil and every other country in which we do business
Siemens  which is based in Munich  Germany  said in an emailed
statement that the company  is not aware of any FBI investigation of
the company related to cartel activity in Brazil   It said its policy
is always to cooperate with law enforcement investigations when they
occur   Amsterdam based Philips confirmed in an email that it is under
investigation in Brazil  In its 2018 annual report  Philips
acknowledged that it  has also received inquiries from certain US
authorities in respect to this matter    In its emailed response to
Reuters  Philips said   It is not uncommon for US authorities to show
an interest in these matters and it is too early to draw any
conclusions    New Brunswick  New Jersey based Johnson   Johnson said
in an emailed response on Friday that in an SEC filing last October it
disclosed that the Department of Justice and the SEC  have made
preliminary inquiries to the company  in regard to a raid by Brazilian
federal police on its Sao Paulo offices last year  and that the
company is cooperating    TRULY MASSIVE   Ferrari  the Brazilian
prosecutor  said the medical equipment investigation was in its early
stages  Still  she said evidence points to widespread bribery and
price gouging by firms looking to tap into Brazil s public healthcare
system  one of the world s largest  serving 210 million people
Because the Brazilian government s health budget is so huge  this
scheme is truly massive   Ferrari said   This first case is just a
tiny sliver of what is to come    In addition to paying kickbacks
through intermediaries to secure contracts  some suppliers charged
Brazil s government inflated prices   up to eight times the market
price   to help cover the cost of their bribes  according to court
filings and plea bargain testimony secured by prosecutors   GE s
former chief executive for Latin America  Daurio Speranzini  and 22
others were charged last year in the first case stemming from the
alleged scheme   Prosecutors say that in that case  which focused on
Rio de Janeiro state  Brazilian taxpayers were bilked out of at least
600 million reais   149 38 million  between 2007 and 2018 through
padded contracts awarded to crooked medical equipment suppliers
Lawyers for Speranzini  who left GE in November  said by email that he
is innocent  GE said in a statement on Friday that  allegations refer
to a time period  when Speranzini was not working for the firm   Based
on our review  we believe there is no evidence of misconduct or any
indication of GE being part of this cartel   However  prosecutors cite
in court filings the plea deal testimony of former Rio de Janeiro
state health secretary Cesar Romero as stating that GE was a member of
the cartel  which he said was known by its members as the
International Bidding Club    In fact  from the analysis of evidence
collected in wire tapping     it was possible to see that Daurio
Speranzini Junior continued to close spurious contracts with the
government   prosecutors wrote in requesting the former GE executive s
arrest last year   Prosecutors allege Speranzini first took part in
the cartel as the head of the Philips Healthcare operation in Latin
America from 2004 until the end of 2010  A whistleblower told Philips
compliance office about the fraud  and Speranzini was fired after an
internal probe  according to the documents   He was hired by GE a few
months after leaving Philips  Investigators say they have strong
evidence that Speranzini continued with the scheme while at GE   GE

Buffett takes the stage at Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  Inc s
shareholders  meeting on Saturday  the 88 year old billionaire will be
greeted  as usual  by tens of thousands of adoring followers from
around the world  Yet the Berkshire chairman and chief executive
officer s optimism about the state of capitalism  a likely theme as he
and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger field questions for five hours  may
appear out of touch with the rise of populism in his country  Buffett
s endorsements of corporate stock buybacks  the much criticized
longtime Berkshire holding  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC   and employer
focused attempts to reform healthcare put the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of
Omaha at odds with the drive among some Americans to tackle income
inequality using root and branch reforms  Many announced Democratic
presidential candidates for 2020 have endorsed such measures as
government sponsored healthcare and the reining in of big banks
policies that might seem antithetical to Buffett s Omaha  Nebraska
based conglomerate  Indeed  Berkshire s m lange of businesses  such as
the utilities MidAmerican Energy and PacifiCorp  parts and equipment
makers Marmon and Precision Castparts  and food distributor McLane
appear more aligned with Republican President Donald Trump s
industrial vision for America  Trump in 2016 defeated Buffett backed
Democrat Hillary Clinton for the White House and championed an
American manufacturing and rural economic renaissance  especially in
its  heartland  where voters provided some of his strongest support
Now  even some of the strong American brands Buffett bet on being
immune to competition are struggling  One such investment  Kraft Heinz
NASDAQ KHC  Co  has lost more than half its value over two years as
consumers moved to foods perceived to be more healthy or natural   The
businesses aren t necessarily bad  but the brands that were a part of
the moat   the reason for the acquisition   are less prominent   said
Meyer Shields  an analyst at Keefe  Bruyette   Woods   That s a
concern   BERKSHIRE LAGS S P 500 Investors appear to have noticed
Berkshire s stock price  which Buffett called the best measure of how
the business is doing  has through Tuesday risen 6 percent this year
compared with a 18 percent rise in the S P 500 index  including
dividends  Buffett s assistant did not respond to an emailed request
for comment  None of this  however  will stop Buffett s fans from
descending on Omaha this weekend  Events will be held around the city
and people can buy mementos such as postage stamps featuring Buffett
and Munger or  for  8 950  a pair of 2 carat weight diamond stud
earrings from Berkshire s Borsheims jewelry unit  Buffett s career of
investing success and down to earth public persona are part of the
draw  He has used his popularity to attract long term shareholders and
lend goodwill and credibility to his business dealings  This included
lucrative investments at the depths of the 2008 financial crisis  when
he provided financing to such companies as  General Electric   NYSE GE
Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and Harley Davidson  DOMINANT STAKES Some
policies endorsed from political left could weigh on Berkshire  though
they could be dead on arrival in the face of a Trump White House and
Republican controlled U S  Senate  For example  some research shows
that when big investors hold large stakes in multiple companies in the
same industry  it might reduce the incentive for those companies to
compete  boosting prices and reducing service for consumers   Those
common ownership  arguments have drawn the attention of U S
regulators  including the Securities and Exchange Commission and
Federal Trade Commission  the latter of which held hearings on the
subject last year  Berkshire owns multibillion dollar stakes in six of
the largest U S  banks plus  American Express   NYSE AXP   It also
owns close to 10 percent of American  Delta and Southwest airlines
and more than 8 percent of another carrier  United Continental
Investors like Warren Buffett   no one seems to have any data about
how much does he get involved in corporate governance   said Martin
Schmalz  associate professor of finance at Oxford University s Sa d
Business School  who has done research on common ownership   The
theory says he does not aggressively push firms to compete more
aggressively   Meanwhile  proposals to expand Medicare come as
Berkshire plows ahead on its Haven joint venture with Amazon com
NASDAQ AMZN  and JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  to cut healthcare costs for
employees at those companies  Buffett also said in February that
Berkshire was likely to become a  significant  buyer of its own stock
especially if it extended its three year drought for major
acquisitions  Some lawmakers have proposed restricting buybacks unless
companies commit to paying their workers more  Berkshire employs more
than 389 000 people  All of this comes as Buffett s advanced age
highlights the need for investors to assess Berkshire once Buffett is

34,GE CEO expects weaker quarters for rest of 2019  higher China tariff costs,"By Alwyn Scott TARRYTOWN  N Y   Reuters     General Electric   NYSE GE
Co Chief Executive Larry Culp said on Wednesday that the company will
likely have weaker quarters for the rest of the year after a
surprisingly good start in the first quarter  The 127 year old Boston
based conglomerate is struggling to recover from a  23 billion loss
last year and Culp  who was named CEO in October  asked investors for
patience during a turnaround that he expects will take two more years
GE s results will balance out through 2019 and its profit and cash
flow forecasts are unchanged  Culp said at his first annual meeting as
the company s CEO  GE faces several hundred million dollars in
increased costs because of tariffs on imports from China  he said  in
response to a question from former presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson  who was among about 200 attendees   Shareholders elected GE s
slate of 10 directors and all management proposals passed  company
officials said at the meeting   But an executive compensation proposal
passed with 70 5 percent of the vote and 29 5 percent against  GE said
which was a relatively low level of support for such measures
Institutional Shareholder Services  ISS  had recommended shareholders
vote against top executives  pay  citing concerns about directors
discretion to set pay   Shareholders approved allowing GE to trim its
minimum board size to seven members from 10  though GE intends to
appoint two more directors  Culp said a smaller board is more flexible
and can talk more easily  around a smaller table    A measure to keep
KPMG as GE s auditor passed with a wider margin than last year
despite concerns that KPMG did not raise alarms about aspects of GE s
accounting that regulators are now investigating   A shareholder
proposal to split the CEO and chairman roles won about 27 percent of
the votes  ISS had recommended a vote for the proposal  saying GE
would benefit from the most robust form of independent boardroom
oversight   GE set its 2019 financial targets last week  which call
for a cash outflow of up to  2 billion    It s still tough for me to
say that out loud   Culp said on Wednesday  referring to the  2
billion figure   But that is our reality   The meeting  held at a
hotel about 30 miles north of New York City  was smaller and less
contentious than last year s meeting at a GE 3 D printing factory near
Pittsburgh  where about 225 attended and union members protested
outside  Before the meeting  Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller told
reporters that one of the biggest changes under Culp is that GE is
focusing on operations in quarterly reviews of its business   In the
past  such reviews were more high level and focused on financial
results first and operations second  she said  noting she and Culp met
with aviation on Monday  healthcare on Tuesday and plan to meet with
the power business in about two weeks  During the tail end of former
CEO Jeff Immelt s 16 year tenure  GE spent more than  15 billion
building up its industrial business only to see most of those
investments sour in 2017 and 2018   GE also sold most of its capital
business  which had supported its earnings growth  while demand for
its power business has fallen sharply  One investor said Immelt s
actions had cost shareholders dearly and asked the company to try to
recover money paid and still being paid to the former GE leader
Clawbacks would be in order  if the board found serious misconduct

35,Ailing Thyssenkrupp drops split plan in favour of elevators float,"By Edward Taylor  Christoph Steitz and Tom K ckenhoff FRANKFURT
Reuters    Germany s Thyssenkrupp  DE TKAG  will embark on a fresh
restructuring and list elevators  its most successful business  after
regulatory opposition sunk plans to hive off its steel division
unravelling its previous break up proposal  Under pressure from
activist investors  Thyssenkrupp had tried to merge its steel unit
with Tata Steel s European operations and split the rest of the
conglomerate in two to highlight the value of its industrial
businesses  But after about three years in the planning  Thyssenkrupp
and India s Tata ditched the steel joint venture on Friday  saying
they were not prepared to offer further concessions to satisfy
European anti trust regulators  At the same time  the steel to
submarines group abandoned a plan to spin off its capital goods
business   car parts  plant engineering and elevators   following a
collapse in its share price since it announced the scheme in September
Under these conditions  a separation is no longer the best solution
for Thyssenkrupp  We can no longer achieve the restart we intended
Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff said  Thyssenkrupp said it would now
cut 6 000 jobs or 4  of its workforce  a third of them in the steel
division  and pursue an initial public offering of the elevator
business  worth an estimated 14 billion euros   16 billion   twice the
parent group s market value  At the same time  Thyssenkrupp said it
will be open to new ownership structures for its car parts  plant
engineering and marine systems units  adding this could result in it
owning a minority stake in them  It expects to keep a majority of its
steel and materials trading divisions in the long term  Shares in
Thyssenkrupp jumped by as much as 28  on the news  first reported by
Reuters  setting them on track for their best day ever  Tata Steel
shares closed down 6 2   Thyssenkrupp has faced investor calls for a
more radical group overhaul for years  with the criticism largely
aimed at its sprawling conglomerate structure  The company said its
new plan  which involves introducing a holding structure to allow more
flexible management of its varied portfolio and will be voted on by
its supervisory board on May 21   would lead to a net loss for the
year  Meanwhile  Tata Steel said it would explore all options for its
European business  including finding a new partner and selling assets
FAILED STRATEGY Thyssenkrupp counts activist investor Cevian  which
has an 18 percent stake  and Elliott  which has a smaller holding in
the conglomerate  among its shareholders  with both having long
demanded operational improvements   It is clear that Thyssenkrupp s
strategy of the past has failed   Cevian founding partner Lars
Foerberg said  The Alfried Krupp von Bohlen and Halbach Stiftung
Thyssenkrupp s largest shareholder with a 21 percent stake  said it
would assess the proposals  adding it wanted to safeguard jobs and a
sustainable ability to pay dividends  Thyssenkrupp s net debt had
nearly doubled to 4 68 billion euros by the end of its fiscal first
quarter  compared with the end of its 2017 2018 business year   more
than 4 times its expected adjusted EBIT  earnings before interest and
tax  for the current fiscal year   Its dividend has remained stagnant
at 0 15 euros per share since 2014 15  Pressure from investors seeking
to realise greater value by breaking up conglomerates led  General
Electric   NYSE GE  to spin off its healthcare business and Siemens to
announce it will separate its gas turbines business  Kerkhoff s idea
at Thyssenkrupp was to separate higher quality capital goods
operations of elevators  auto suppliers and core plant construction
from its other more cyclical businesses  He said he would now  swiftly
prepare  but wait for the right moment for an elevators IPO  in which
Thyssenkrupp would initially keep a majority  The group said it wants
to be market ready in the new financial year  which starts in October
All stakeholders now believe that a fundamentally new direction is
urgently needed to give the company s businesses a future  There can
be no historical or political taboos     if Thyssenkrupp wants to
sincerely tackle underperformance and get the businesses back to
growth   Cevian s Foerberg said  Specialised businesses are often more
highly valued than conglomerates because in times of growth  high
potential assets do not have to compete for the combined balance sheet
with businesses offering lower returns  But rising trade tensions
between the United States and China  and fears of a disorderly Brexit
have dented share prices  forcing companies including Continental and
Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  to review plans for spin offs and listings
Thyssenkrupp said it now expects to post adjusted earnings before
interest and tax of 1 1 billion euros to 1 2 billion euros  and to
post negative cashflow in the high three digit million euros range for
the 2018 2019 year",2019-05-10,Reuters
36,U S  accuses pair of stealing secrets  spying on GE to aid China,"By Sarah N  Lynch and David Shepardson WASHINGTON  Reuters    A former
engineer and a Chinese businessman have been charged with economic
espionage and conspiring to steal trade secrets from  General Electric
NYSE GE  Co to benefit China  according to an indictment unsealed by
the U S  Justice Department on Tuesday   The indictment against the
former GE engineer  Xiaoqing Zheng  and Chinese businessman Zhaoxi
Zhang  comes after Zheng was initially charged in August in connection
with the alleged theft  It marks the first time the U S  government
has formally said the scheme was carried out to benefit China and that
the Chinese government provided  financial and other support
According to the indictment  Zheng stole the proprietary data on GE s
turbine technology by encrypting the files on his computer and
secretly embedding them into a digital photograph of sunset before
emailing the photograph to his personal email  Zheng  56  pleaded not
guilty on Tuesday and was allowed to remain free on bond  His attorney
Kevin Luibrand declined to comment  The charges are the latest in a
handful of cases brought by the Justice Department since last year as
part of a broader crackdown by the Trump administration  which has
vowed to fight Chinese theft of corporate secrets  cheating through
intellectual property theft  illegal corporate subsidies and the use
of rules that hamper U S  corporations that want to sell their goods
in China  The FBI has said in the past that nearly every one of the
agency s 56 field offices have investigations into economic espionage
tied to China  The 14 count indictment against the pair charges that
Zheng  who worked at GE Power   Water in Schenectady  New York  stole
multiple electronic files containing details about design models
engineering drawings and other specifications related to the company s
gas and steam turbines  Prosecutors say he emailed the files to Zhang
who was located in China  GE said in a statement it has  been in close
cooperation with the FBI and the U S  Attorney s Office for some time
on this matter   The two men allegedly used the stolen information to
advance their own business interests in two turbine research and
development companies   Liaoning Tianyi Aviation Technology Co Ltd and
Nanjing Tianyi Avi Tech Co Ltd   The indictment adds that the pair
received financial and other support from the Chinese government
through those two companies  and they coordinated with Chinese
government officials  According to the indictment  Zheng told GE in
February 2016 that he was operating an aviation parts supply company
in China with his brothers  and asked permission to ensure it did not
violate any rules about conflicts of interest  GE approved his
proposal  asking that he protect the company s intellectual property
About a year later  around November or December 2017  GE discovered a
large number of encrypted files saved on Zheng s computer  By July
2018  the company learned he had embedded the files in the seemingly
innocuous photo of a sunset and emailed them to himself   In
interviews with the FBI in August 2018  prosecutors said he admitted
to taking GE files  He also told agents his companies in China had
received grant money from the Chinese government   Zheng and Zhang  46
were formally indicted on April 18  A jury trial has been set for June
24 in Albany  New York  Zhang was believed to be in China  the Justice
Department said",2019-04-23,Reuters
37,ABB seeks new chief executive after Spiesshofer s surprise departure,"By John Revill ZURICH  Reuters    ABB Chief Executive Ulrich
Spiesshofer has quit the Swiss engineering group in a surprise move
for a company which is in the midst of a strategic overhaul to focus
more on digital industries  Chairman Peter Voser will take charge at
ABB  which is selling its Power Grids business to Japan s Hitachi in
an  11 billion deal and seeking to become more of an industrial
automation company  Spiesshofer agreed with the board to step down
from the post he has held for the last five and half years and a
search has begun for a successor  ABB said  without giving any reason
for the departure  During his tenure Spiesshofer positioned ABB toward
more profitable areas like industrial automation and robotics  buying
companies like Austria s Bernecker   Rainer and General Electric s
industrial solutions business  But Spiesshofer s exit follows the
apparent lack of investor enthusiasm for the former management
consultant whose overhauls failed to revitalize ABB s shares  which
gained 4 percent in early trade on news of his departure to touch a
six month high  ABB s stock has lost 6 5 percent since Spiesshofer
took over in September 2013  trailing rivals like Germany s Siemens
which have gained nearly 19 percent in the same time  Patience appears
to have worn thin when major strategy u turns like the decision to
offload Power Grids to Hitachi last December failed to boost the stock
which has languished well below the 35 franc level Spiesshofer
promised to reach  Investor AB  ABB s largest shareholder  said the
time was ripe for a change of leadership  CUSTOMER VALUE  Investor AB
fully supports the ABB board and management s new strategic direction
with a simplified and decentralized organizational structure and full
focus on delivering customer value and needs for digitalization
electrification  automation and robotics   an Investor spokeswoman
said by email    We support the board s decision that now is the right
time for a new person at the helm in order to speed up the execution
of the new strategy and deliver on the key financial targets   she
added  Cevian Capital  ABB s second largest shareholder with a 5 3
percent stake  said   We support the strategic direction of ABB  and
have full confidence in Peter Voser and the management team to
continue implementing the transformation of ABB   ABB has also been
dogged by problems with its internal financial controls  which led to
reduced bonuses for some executive committee members  ABB said its
revenue increased by 4 percent on a comparable basis during the first
quarter  although net income dropped 6 percent as profitability fell
due to the integration of the low margin  General Electric   NYSE GE
Industrial Solutions business  Voser  the former Royal Dutch Shell
LON RDSa  CEO who was ABB s chief financial officer from 2002 to 2004
said he would continue to make ABB more of an industrial automation

the divestment of ABB s Power Grids business as planned  simplify the
organizational structure of the group and deliver cost savings   Voser

38,Expense report of the future reduces fraud and headaches,"By Beth Pinsker NEW YORK Reuters    It sounds like it should have been
impossible to miss  but it took more than a year for an industrial
equipment company to discover  12 000 worth of doggie day spa charges
on an employee s expense reports  Level upon level of corporate
management also failed to detect that the same employee was running a
scheme to sell more than  200 000 in company equipment on eBay  NASDAQ
EBAY    Only a fraction of expense reports are closely examined  so it
is no wonder that companies experience more than  7 billion in annual
losses from fraud  according to the Association of Certified Fraud
Examiners  By using robots  instead of relying on random spot checks
companies are catching fraud more than twice as fast and fraud losses
are halved  said Andi McNeal  director of research for the Association
of Certified Fraud Examiners  That is what happened when the
industrial equipment company put in place an artificial intelligence
program from Oversight Systems  which was able to quickly ferret out
the culprit   It started out as a small infraction that led to an
investigation that led to other things   said Terrence McCrossan
chief executive of Atlanta based Oversight Systems  which audits about
2 trillion worth of employee spending each year and works with
employers like the U S  Department of Defense  McDonald s and  General
Electric   NYSE GE   The expense reporting universe is being
overhauled to use artificial intelligence to get a 100 percent
overview of employee submissions  In addition to monitoring fraud
companies are streamlining the way employees file expenses   Soon
employees around the world will stop fussing with paper receipts and
crying over hotel bills  then waiting weeks to get reimbursed while
their paperwork travels through the corporate labyrinth  Managers will
no longer be stuck in the middle of the process  policing spending
and companies will stop losing so much money to waste and fraud  TEST
CASES Some changes have already occurred  ranging from corporate card
charges that automatically attach to electronic expense reports to
seamless experiences for business travelers who stay at approved
hotels   One of SAP Concur s newest offerings is Concur Detect by
AppZen  which does a 100 percent audit of incoming expense reports
AppZen analyzes expenses by looking for risk  Only about 10 percent of
expenses that flow through a company have a problem that needs to be
addressed  said Anant Kale  CEO of AppZen  based in San Jose
California   The algorithm can clear expense reports with no issues
almost instantly  so that these employee outlays can be reimbursed as
quickly as two days   If a charge has a red flag  it goes to a human
auditor  One Concur Detect customer  Portola Pharmaceuticals Inc  said
it had reduced the number of expense reports that required review by
one third  Kale has been surprised by the kind of problems that are
popping up since AppZen s 2016 launch    Employees are claiming the
same expense multiple times  That happens more often than you can
imagine   Kale said   It s not fraud  but an honest mistake    AppZen
also finds many expenses that are disallowed by corporate policy  Some
of these are for strip clubs  in room movies during business travel or
charging gifts at a hotel shop   Oversight Systems has identified
questionable expenses like eyelash extensions  lost sunglasses and an
employee who billed for a new shirt after he spilled coffee on himself
on the way to a meeting   There is also true fraud  Oversight Systems
for instance  found an employee who expensed for parking over and over
using the same receipt each time  By the time the fraud was discovered
the parking lot no longer even existed   What makes the difference
between catching wrongdoers and companies  losing money  Better
compliance and making audits more efficient  said the Association of
Certified Fraud Examiners  McNeal   As much as machines can learn and
improve their performance  people are more complicated  AppZen  for
instance  has yet to run a clean screen on a company where it catches
no problems  no matter how much effort a company puts into employee
education and catching disallowed expenses before they are filed
You re never going to get all of them to comply   that s just human
nature   McNeal said   You re just trying to let the fewest grains get
through the sieve",2019-03-25,Reuters
39,U S  test nuclear reactor may run 40 percent over cost  government document,"By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON  Reuters    The flagship of the Trump
administration s advanced nuclear power research program could cost
about 40 percent more than a government official estimated earlier
this year  a U S  Department of Energy document shows  Energy
Secretary Rick Perry has tried to breathe life into the country s
nuclear power industry  which is suffering in the face of competition
from plants burning cheap natural gas as well as falling costs for
wind and solar power  Perry announced the versatile test reactor  or
VTR  in late February  saying it was a  key step to implementing
President  Donald  Trump s direction to revitalize and expand the U S
nuclear industry   and critical for national security   The VTR would
let U S  companies conduct advanced technology and fuels tests without
having to go to competitors in Russia and China  Perry said  Meant to
be built by late 2025  it would be the first new nuclear test reactor
built by the Energy Department  or DOE  in many decades  Perry did not
put a price on the reactor  which would be led by the department s
Idaho National Laboratory  But an internal DOE document dated Jan  22
obtained by public policy group the Union of Concerned Scientists  UCS
through a freedom of information request  puts the estimated cost for
construction and starting the VTR at  3 9 billion to  6 billion  The
document  seen by Reuters on Thursday  had not been reported
previously  The high end of that range is about 40 percent more than
an estimate by Kemal Pasamehmetoglu  the head of the Idaho National
Laboratory s VTR program  who was quoted in the Morning Consult news
outlet in February saying it would cost up to  3 5 billion in today s
dollars  The calculation of the jump in the cost is affected by the
Energy Department s estimate which included cost escalations of up to
3 8 percent annually   The UCS estimated that VTR s cost for the next
seven years would be about  550 million to  850 million annually
compared to the  740 million appropriated in the fiscal year 2019
budget for the department s entire advanced nuclear technology
development  which contained just  65 million for VTR   If successful
the VTR is meant to lead to a new wave of so called fast reactors
reviving nuclear power companies  Fast reactors breed their own fuel
unlike today s fleet of light water reactors  They also have a safety
benefit of allowing a plant to operate under low pressure conditions
But critics worry that the fuel cycle of fast reactors will likely
depend on the reprocessing or recycling of plutonium or uranium  both
of which can be used as fissile materials for nuclear weapons    Fast
reactors are less safe  less secure  and more proliferation prone than
light water reactors   said Ed Lyman  a senior scientist at UCS   The
DOE should not be asking taxpayers to spend billions on this dangerous
reactor    Lyman also said cheaper approaches for testing to support
fast reactor development could be done at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory  the DOE sponsored research and development center in
Tennessee  The DOE did not immediately respond to a request for
comment    VTR has already led to business for nuclear companies  In
November  the Idaho lab said it had contracted GE Hitachi Nuclear  a
venture between  General Electric   NYSE GE  Co and Hitachi Ltd  to
support the conceptual design and safety activities for an unspecified

Big investors in Saudi Arabia are pushing ahead with deals and pouring
money back into its stock market as the kingdom tries to move on from
the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi  His killing at the
hands of Saudi agents in October strained ties with Western allies and
Riyadh is keen to repair its image  It wants to attract foreign
capital and knowhow as part of its Vision 2030 plan of reforms to
diversify the economy of the world s top oil exporter and create jobs
for Saudis  Some Western governments said Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman was implicated in the murder  The Saudi government has denied
any connection to the crown prince  Deterred by the case  some Western
firms in the technology and entertainment sectors have distanced
themselves from Saudi Arabia  But several U S  multinationals told

show it is business as usual  It sent a senior delegation to the World
Economic Forum in Davos and packed executives  agendas with meetings
Last month it announced  54 4 billion in deals and offered fresh
incentives under a 10 year industrial program that aims to attract
427 billion in investment  The crown prince  who is the driving force
behind the reforms  agreed several deals last month during an Asian
tour including  28 billion with China  It also wound down a 15 month
anti corruption campaign that netted scores of senior princes
ministers and top businessmen and unnerved investors  BUSINESS FORGETS
Foreign investors appear to have taken note  They poured 6 94 billion
riyals   1 85 billion  into the Saudi market in the first two months
of 2019  according to Saudi stock exchange data  The index is up more
than 8 percent  outperforming its Gulf peers  compared to a fall of
about 9 percent within two weeks of Khashoggi s disappearance and
killing  Several executives pulled out of a major investment forum in
Riyadh last year but a Western diplomat said this year s event is
expected to attract big names   Business tends to forget more quickly
than social conscience   the diplomat said  Investors are now looking
ahead to the inclusion of Saudi stocks in the MSCI s emerging markets
benchmark this year and focusing on the pace of economic reforms
bankers say   There s too much opportunity for investment in Saudi
Arabia   said Nick Wilson  chairman of the  100 million Gulf

41,What General Electric investors want from CEO on Thursday,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK  Reuters    Portfolio manager Michael Kon
began buying  General Electric   NYSE GE  Co shares about a year ago
and got more last fall after GE Chief Executive Larry Culp outlined
plans to reboot the ailing power plant unit   I wouldn t say that they
ve got their arms around it   Kon  who is also research director at
investment firm value oriented Golub Group LLC  said of the power
trouble    But at least they ve identified all the issues    Culp has
a chance to attract more investors by providing greater clarity on GE
s strategy when he and other GE leaders lay out their 2019 financial
forecast on Thursday   Wall Street analysts expect GE to earn 70 cents
a share this year and generate  1 9 billion in free cash flow  on
average  according to data from Refinitiv  GE optimists  spurred by
Culp s actions  have fueled a 53 percent rally from the stock s low in
December  As the first outsider to head the 127 year old conglomerate
Culp has cracked open GE s books to more scrutiny  shaken up its board
and stationed new leaders in trouble spots like power and insurance
But Culp still faces many skeptics who dumped the stock as GE racked
up staggering losses of more than  30 billion over the last two years
and cut its dividend to near zero  The camps are unusually divided  Of
19 analysts who cover the company  nine rate its stock  hold  or
strong sell  while 10 rate it  buy  or  strong buy   according to
Refinitiv   MURKY OUTLOOK Those views did not change much even after
GE reported a  22 billion loss in January or told investors last week
its industrial businesses will lose cash in 2019  GE shares are down
15 percent since Culp took over in October  and they are worth less
than a third of their value in 2016  Some analysts count Culp s candor
as positive and say the cash flow warning shows serious investment in
restructuring  But others say the changes have clouded GE s outlook
and want Culp to paint a credible picture of its future   GE s
strategy of selling assets to pay off its outsized debt  for example
is ditching some of its most cash generative businesses  such as rail
and biopharma  said John Inch  analyst at Gordon Haskett Research
Advisors  GE s power unit has cut 12 000 jobs and 30 percent of
facility space but plans to spend more on restructuring this year  he
added   Just exactly what are you doing in power with all that
restructuring money   Inch asked  GE s forced asset sales also mean GE
is not getting good prices  said Oliver Pursche  chief market
strategist at Bruderman Asset Management LLC   Investors who buy GE
stock thinking it is cheap are ignoring cash outflows  strategy
uncertainty and the fact that GE cannot afford to pay a dividend   The
reality is  it s at  9 for a very good reason   said Pursche  who s
firm sold when GE cut its dividend in 2017 and won t buy until the
dividend returns and the outlook is clear     Until you get a cohesive
growth strategy   he said   there s no compelling reason to invest",2019-03-14,Reuters

will invest more heavily in junk bonds  private equity and other high
yield investments to boost returns at its ailing insurance business
company executives said on Thursday  Seeking to calm investors about
its insurance liabilities  GE said its insurance investments are too
conservative compared with competitors  The change will allow for
better returns that help reduce the amount of reserves it must set
aside for claims  Anthony Grandolfo  the chief investment officer of

about increased risk  he said GE was still being prudent   We re
starting from a point where we think  the portfolio  is quite
conservative and we expect to continue to maintain a portfolio that is
quite conservative   said Grandolfo  who was hired as GE s first
dedicated chief investment officer for insurance in October  Only 2
percent of GE s insurance assets are currently in non investment grade
investments   much less than the 12 percent average in the industry
Grandolfo said  citing a Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  study  GE plans to
gradually increase its level to 8 percent by 2024  he added  GE has
also hired two other executives to run its insurance unit  Chief
Executive Officer Tim Kneeland  who formerly handled long term care
policies at Transamerica  and Managing Director Bob Deutsch  former

place  It is also pressing for  1 2 billion in further increases to
help stem losses on some 300 000 long term care insurance policies
which cover costs for services such as in home or nursing home care
GE shares were up 2 3 percent at  9 32 on Thursday   Investor focus
now turns to GE s presentation of its full year forecast  scheduled
for March 14   GE shocked investors when it took a surprise  6 2
billion after tax charge last year and began setting aside  15 billion
one of the largest such amounts ever   to cover the policies that were
underwritten more than a decade ago  when actuaries did not yet know
how costly the claims would become   GE s insurance losses are among a
host of problems the 127 year old company is facing as it attempts a
breakup under new Chief Executive Larry Culp in an effort to restore
profit and buoy its stock  which has tumbled to less than a third of
its value in mid 2016  The company also said it is looking at  options
to reduce its insurance risk  adding to hints from Culp on Tuesday
about possible sales of parts of the business   GE s massive power
plant business is hemorrhaging cash and contending with falling sales
and technical problems  while the company is selling assets to pay
down its outsized debt  Since last year  GE has reduced the total
amount of insurance reserves it plans to set aside to  14 5 billion by
2024 after completing an analysis of the policies   But some analysts
have said GE may need to nearly double that amount because assumptions
it used to calculate the exposure are optimistic   As a reinsurer  GE
cannot seek premium increases directly  It must rely on about 30
companies that underwrote the policies it holds to seek increases from
regulators in the numerous U S  states where they were sold  GE s
target for new reserves amounts to about  55 000 per policy  compared

43,Will  14 5 billion plug GE s long term care insurance hole  Some experts say  No ,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK  Reuters     General Electric   NYSE GE  Co is
setting aside one of the largest amounts ever to cover potential
losses on policies that provide long term care in nursing facilities
and patients  homes  But insurance experts are concerned that may not
be enough  GE shocked investors last year when it took a  6 2 billion
after tax charge and said it planned to set aside  15 billion over
seven years to cover claims on some 300 000 long term care policies
written more than a decade ago  when actuaries did not yet know how
costly the claims would become   The costs  which far exceeded GE s
estimates  sent its shares tumbling  spurred an investor lawsuit and
prompted the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate
Last week  GE provided new details about its insurance and scheduled a
teach in  for Thursday to give more information  GE s new reserves
amount to about  55 000 per policy  in line with those of other long
term care insurers  according to an analysis for Reuters by Audit
Analytics  an independent research company based in Massachusetts
For comparison   Humana Inc   NYSE HUM  has set aside  77 282 per
policy  while  Unum Group   NYSE UNM  has set aside  10 614  Audit
Analytics said  For a graphic  click   Those amounts are less than the
cost of one year s stay in a private nursing home room  which averages
92 376 in the United States  the U S  Department of Health and Human
Services said   GE has since cut  500 million from the  15 billion in
reserves it plans to make for the policies through 2024  Its latest
loss recognition test required only a  65 million after tax charge  a
sign  it said  that its estimates are on track  But GE s disclosures
and reserves have not eliminated fears that insurance could bring more
pain to GE and its investors   I think it is impossible to know
whether the  15 billion is enough   Joseph Belth  professor emeritus
of insurance at Indiana University  who has written extensively about
long term care policies  told Reuters after reviewing GE s disclosures
Long term care coverage  which typically pays for in home  assisted
living or skilled nursing care  has required many insurers to boost
reserves in recent years  In one rare case  regulators in 2017 placed
Penn Treaty American Corp  a U S  insurer that wrote such policies  in
liquidation due to losses  Unlike  say  fire insurance on a home
which is unlikely to pay out  most long term care policies do pay
claims eventually  Policies can be imprecise about what is covered
leaving room for legal battles that make costs hard for insurers to
estimate  experts said  And policy holders or family members usually
decide when and where to seek care  which made it tricky for insurers
in the early days to set premiums that cover costs over time    A VERY
RISKY PRODUCT   It s very hard to put your arms around the risk   said
Bruno Caron  a credit analyst at A M  Best  a New Jersey based credit
rating agency that specializes in insurance companies   Increasing
reserves generally reduces the risk of future losses  but  sometimes
reserves signal a deficiency in a block of policies that reoccurs in
the same block   Caron said   We view long term care insurance as a
very risky product   GE said it set reserves based on assumptions that
reflect its  emerging experience  with long term care policies
Several analysts said GE is being overly optimistic  GE would need
another  12 billion in reserves if it stopped assuming that generally
better health means fewer people will seek care  known as  morbidity
improvement   and changed other favorable assumptions as some rivals
have  said John Inch  an analyst at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors
Others noted GE lost out on premium increases that rivals got by
moving quickly when long term care costs became apparent   They  GE
were very slow in reacting to emerging experience relative to peers
said Douglas Meyer  a long term care insurance specialist and managing
director at Fitch Ratings  Now GE has  significantly less repricing
flexibility  because it cannot make up for past premium increases
others received  Two GE subsidiaries hold its long term care insurance
Employers Reassurance Corp and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Co  Both
are reinsurers  which means GE must pay out on policies that others
wrote and is prevented from seeking premium rate increases directly
from state insurance commissions  experts said  It is unclear how many
companies that wrote the coverage have sought increase for policies in
GE s portfolio  they added    GE said that it is working with insurers
to obtain increases  Its reserve calculation anticipates about  1 7
billion in premium increases or benefit reductions  but those include
increases that are not yet approved by regulators and requests for
increases that have not yet been filed",2019-03-04,Reuters
44,GE s CEO warns of negative industrial cash flow in 2019  shares drop,"By Alwyn Scott and Rachit Vats  Reuters     General Electric   NYSE GE
Co s chief executive surprised investors on Tuesday by forecasting a
net cash outflow from its industrial businesses this year mainly due
to its ailing power plant unit  a gloomy outlook that sent shares and
bonds tumbling   Industrial free cash flow will be  in  negative
territory   compared with a positive  4 5 billion last year  CEO Larry
Culp said in a webcast interview with JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  analyst
Stephen Tusa  a longtime GE bear   The shock remark dealt a fresh blow
to GE investors who have watched the Boston based conglomerate slash
its dividend as it took massive asset write downs and huge insurance
charges last year  The stock is up nearly 36 percent this year but is
still worth less than a third of its value in mid 2016   I don t want
to sugarcoat  the problems in GE s power business  Culp said  adding
the unit likely will lose more cash in 2019 than the  2 7 billion in
free cash flow it lost in 2018  The cash forecast shows  demand for GE
s  power  turbines is half what the company forecast two years ago
and this is likely to persist into 2020   said Jim Corridore  an
analyst at CFRA  who rates GE a  buy   The stock swiftly fell below
10  the company s biggest intraday percentage drop in more than three
months  which knocked more than  4 billion off GE s market value  The
shares closed 4 7 percent lower at  9 89 on Tuesday after falling as
much as 7 6 percent  GE s bonds also declined  with GE Capital bonds
the hardest hit  A  2 25 billion issue at 4 5 percent coming due in
March 2044 was down 1 65 percent    The risk of additional debt
ratings downgrades has now increased   said John Inch  an analyst at
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors  who rates GE  underperform   GE s
bonds are rated three notches above junk and it is selling assets to
reduce its high level of debt  Culp s comments went well beyond his
January warning that industrial free cash flow  which excludes GE
Capital dividends and cash from asset sales  would weaken in 2019
Investors are looking closely at GE s cash because of the gap between
cash and earnings   Profits collapsed at GE s power unit in mid 2017
as sales fell and the company failed to deliver on promises to
increase margins after a  10 billion acquisition of  Alstom   PA ALSO
of France   Since then  GE has blamed the power unit s losses  which
totaled  22 billion last year  on its own poor management and a shift
toward new wind and solar power plants  The power unit is spending at
least  480 million to fix thousands of turbine blades that are at risk
after blades broke in 2015 and 2018  causing serious damage to power
turbines and coinciding with a drop in GE s market share  GE also has
poured billions of dollars into its insurance business  which includes
thousands of money losing long term care policies written more than a
decade ago  Some experts said GE may have to spend billions more to
cover claims   Culp said the power business would face headwinds for
a couple of years   would not resolve problems with breaking power
turbine blades for  a while  and promised to step up restructuring in
the business and elsewhere  GE declined to provide restructuring cost
estimates  The company is due to publish a financial forecast on March
14  Culp said on Tuesday that GE would continue to provide cash to its
GE Capital unit for the foreseeable future  though probably not as
much as the  4 billion it provided last year    GE Capital used to pay
dividends to the parent company  but that stopped after losses mounted
at GE s reinsurance business in the second half of 2017",2019-03-05,Reuters

the clearest sign yet the two countries were closing in on an
agreement to end their prolonged trade spat  which has slowed global
growth and disrupted markets  But gains were capped after weeks of

46,GE inks  21 billion biopharma sale to Danaher in U turn under Culp,"By Ankit Ajmera and Manas Mishra  Reuters     General Electric   NYSE
GE  said on Monday it would sell its biopharma business to Danaher
Corp  NYSE DHR  for  21 4 billion in the biggest strategy reversal
since Lawrence Culp took over as the industrial conglomerate s chief
executive in September  GE rejected an approach by Danaher for that
business a year ago  But its stance changed after Culp was appointed
CEO and GE board s became more open to a deal  according to people
familiar with the negotiations who requested anonymity to discuss them
As a result  GE will receive some  20 billion in net proceeds which it
will use to trim its debt pile  which stood at  121 billion at the end
of December   Both GE s and Danaher s shares jumped on news of the
deal  though GE still faces significant hurdles in recovering its
former corporate glory  It lost two thirds of its market value in the
last two years amid a series of operational and investment missteps
Among its challenges are mismanagement of orders and operations in its
power business  and dealing with its toxic long term care insurance
liabilities in its GE Capital arm     The GE Danaher deal
unfortunately doesn t solve the real issues which comes back to power
That s what took the stock down  and that s still going to take some
time play out   said Richard Grasfeder  a portfolio manager at Boston
Private Wealth LLC  which held about 478 204 shares in GE as of the
end of 2018  down from 787 600 shares a year earlier  Culp said on
Monday the sale to Danaher  where he was instrumental in revitalizing
the company as its CEO  was a pivotal milestone in efforts to turn
around GE  a 126 year old conglomerate   It demonstrates that we are
executing on our strategy by taking thoughtful and deliberate action
to reduce leverage and strengthen our balance sheet   Culp said in a
statement  The biopharma sale also propelled a broad rally in GE s
roughly  120 billion of bonds  which had taken a pounding in late 2018
as it became clear that earlier restructuring efforts were falling
short and that the company would need to take more aggressive action
to address its debt load in particular  Larry Culp  has earned his
stripes  It is clear that nobody in his job before him   John Flannery
or Jeff Immelt   would have probably been able to pull off this
transaction with Danaher   William Blair   Co analyst Nicholas Heymann
said   And the price Danaher is paying GE is two times our
expectations  This is a home run  It really turns the page now for GE
to address liquidity concerns   Heymann adds  Until recently  the
company had plans to spin off the entire healthcare unit  Culp
however  said in January that GE would sell nearly half of the unit
Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday that GE will
put the initial public offering of the unit on hold until the deal
with Danaher closes  expected in the second half of the year  This
would mean that GE is likely to retain access to the earnings and cash
flows of the remaining healthcare businesses for a longer period of
time  alleviating some cash concerns  even as the power business
struggles  said Rene Lipsch  lead GE analyst at Moody s  BOOST FOR
DANAHER The purchase is also the biggest yet for Danaher  which has a
history of deal making  and half of its revenue has come from
companies it has acquired in the past seven years   The deal will
expand Danaher s presence in the biopharma industry  providing it with
access to tools for research and development of drugs  Shares of the
medical equipment maker rose more than 9 percent to a record  124 07
Danaher expects to add 45 cents to 50 cents per share to its adjusted
profit in the first full year after the deal closes  and does not
expect any  significant  anti trust challenges   These are really
complementary businesses when you look across the portfolio of the
product line on GE biopharma s side and our side   said Danaher s
Chief Executive Officer Thomas Joyce on a call with analysts  The
biopharma business accounted for 15 percent of GE s healthcare
business revenue in 2018  It makes instruments and software that
support the research and development of drugs  The sale leaves GE s
healthcare unit with its medical device unit  which makes X ray  CT
scan and MRI machines  and its pharmaceuticals diagnostic unit  The
announcement also further eased concerns about GE s solvency that had
grown markedly last year  reflected in a surge in the price for GE
credit default swaps  CDS  during the fourth quarter  a form of
insurance against default  On Monday  GE s CDS prices sank to their
lowest since mid October   GE  which reported lower than expected
fourth quarter profit in January  is expected to provide its 2019
outlook on a call on March 14",2019-02-25,Reuters
47,Few tears shed by French workers after Macron s Alstom dream is blocked,"By Richard Lough and Gilbert Reilhac BELFORT  France  Reuters    After
four decades on the production line at French trainmaker  Alstom   PA
ALSO   Claude Gemino had little sympathy for Emmanuel Macron when
Brussels scotched the French president s hopes of creating a European
rail champion  For Gemino and many co workers at Alstom s Belfort
factory  Macron s support for the blocked merger with Germany s
Siemens signaled a readiness to put shareholders ahead of jobs and
protecting France s fragile manufacturing sector  But the European
Commission s veto last week has raised doubts about the president s
industrial strategy as he battles to quell unrest over inequality and
a perception he is indifferent to the struggles of France s working
class  The workers  disdain for Macron s industrial plan reflects a
broader lower class anger at the former investment banker s reforms
designed to liberalize and invigorate France s heavily regulated
economy   Violent  yellow vest  anti government protests have
convulsed France for the past three months and raised questions over
whether the man dubbed the  president of the rich  by left wingers can
make France more competitive   The order books are apparently pretty
full  Management tells us we re covered for the next four or five
years   Gemino  who joined Alstom as a teenage apprentice  said as he
passed through the plant s turnstile   The future isn t so bleak
Alstom and Siemens wanted to merge their train manufacturing
businesses to compete more effectively against China s state owned
CRRC  the world s biggest trainmaker  at a time rail companies
globally are looking to consolidate and reduce costs through economies
of scale  Alstom s unions say the company  with booked orders of 40
billion euros   45 billion   is strong enough to survive alone and
they would prefer to take on China without German help   There will
always be a risk  but Alstom and Siemens are capable of looking after
themselves  on their own  and of pushing back against China   said
Olivier Kohler  an Alstom employee and member of the moderate CFDT
union  France s largest   Even if there was a merger  their prices
would still be lower   Asked if Alstom could compete globally alone
an official in Macron s office said   In the short term  yes  It s
making money  The problem is the long term   they said  SHORT TERM WIN
At the foot of Belfort s imposing citadel stands a giant statue of a
lion carved out of red sandstone  symbolizing the town s resistance
against German forces during the Franco Prussian war of 1870  Nowadays
it s Alstom s fate in the face of foreign competition that weighs
heavily on the collective psyche of Belfort  a town of 50 000 near
Germany and Switzerland where the iconic high speed TGV  Train a
Grande Vitesse  is made    Alstom is part of the town s identity
said retired SNCF railworker Georges Pagnoncelle   But French
industrial groups keep on being bought by foreign firms  and jobs keep
disappearing from France    Alstom s unions were worried that a merger
with Siemens would lead to the bleeding of jobs in France  but
acknowledged the European Commission s veto was only a short term
reprieve   The threat from China and trainmakers in other emerging
economies such as South Korea will persist and future alliances cannot
be ruled out  Frustrated by the rejection of the Siemens Alstom deal
Paris and Berlin now want to loosen European competition rules to take
a more global view  Unionized managers at Belfort said they understood
why the French government might want to merge Alstom with Siemens  but
maintained that any such move must be on a 50 50 footing  protect jobs
and fit into a clearer long term strategy  Under the terms of the
proposal  the German conglomerate would have taken a stake of 50
percent plus a few shares in Alstom with an undertaking not to boost
its holding above 50 5 percent in the first four years  Alstom workers
said Siemens would have been left in the driving seat   We need a
political vision for French industry   said Andre Fages of the CFE CGC
union that represents management  stressing the need for investment in
research and development   Our politicians say France needs a strong
rail industry  But when they want to buy trains  they want them at
Chinese prices   MACRON CONUNDRUM Alstom was Belfort s biggest
employer until 2014 when it sold its turbine manufacturing business to
U S  company  General Electric   NYSE GE   Two years later  the then
Socialist government threw a lifeline 630 million euro order for TGVs
it did not yet need to stop Alstom shutting down the Belfort
production line  In a reflection of France s industrial decline
Alstom s TGV plant is now surrounded by towering structures bearing
General Electric s logo  Across a rail track stand rows of violet
shuttered terraced dwellings that once housed Alstom workers  The town
s mayor  Damien Meslot  said the trainmaker now employed just 480
workers in Belfort  one of a dozen Alstom sites across France  General
Electric  which France fined last week for reneging on a commitment to
create 1 000 jobs  has some 4 000 staff in Belfort  High labor costs
a lack of automation and insufficient investment in innovation have
eroded French industrial competitiveness since the late 1990s
according to economists   France produces the same quality of products
as Spain but at a labor cost that is 20 percent higher  said Patrick
Artus  chief economist at French bank Natixis   He said French workers
were only fractionally cheaper than German employees in terms of unit
cost  but produced an inferior product   I keep telling French
politicians that we sell  Renault   PA RENA  cars with the wages of
BMW workers   Artus said  France s weak competitiveness underscores
the conundrum Macron faces as he searches for a way to take the sting
out of the  yellow vest  rebellion  The anti Macron protesters  many
of whom are low income blue collar workers  have railed since November
against Macron s reforms to liberalize the economy and create a better
trained  more highly skilled and flexible labor force  There are signs
the reforms are bearing fruit  The protesters  though  want more
protection from foreign corporations  a higher minimum salary and more
money in household coffers  Macron has already bolstered pay for the
lowest earners this year  More increases would only weaken French
competitiveness  and productivity still needs to rise  economists say
I don t see how Macron will get out of this crisis   Artus said  In
Belfort s town hall  framed photographs of Alstom s factory adorn the
office of the mayor  who is a member of the conservative opposition
party Les Republicains  Meslot said Macron and the president s
socialist predecessor  Francois Hollande  had abandoned French
industry  putting shareholder dividends over long term strategy     No
one knows what will become of the Alstom Belfort plant  For the town s
mayor  that s a worry   Meslot said",2019-02-12,Reuters

49,The Misguided Schumer Sanders Buyback Solution," Bloomberg Opinion     Senators Bernie Sanders and Chuck Schumer think
companies are spending too much on buybacks and dividends to the
detriment of their workers and communities  In a New York Times op ed
they are proposing legislation that would restrict corporations from
repurchasing stock unless they  among other things  agree to pay all
workers at least  15 an hour and offer better pension and health
benefits  The senators  solution  though  would reward bad investments
and most likely lead to more corporate waste rather than improve the
lives of the workers they are trying to help  Sanders and Schumer are
right that companies are spending a lot on buybacks   more than  4
trillion between 2008 and 2017  roughly equal to the Federal Reserve s
quantitative easing stimulus program  More than likely some  perhaps a
lot  of that money has been wasted  As Warren Buffett has said  if the
intrinsic value of a company is  100 and executives decide to buy back
stock at  120 a share  they are essentially wiping out  20 of
shareholder value every time they purchase stock   Buybacks are
seductive because they lift earnings per share quickly by reducing the
number of shares outstanding  Even for investors  though  repurchases
are not always positive  They can mask problems  like slowing business
growth  and cause investors to overpay for shares  particularly when
buybacks are not sustainable  And buybacks hide the cost of stock
based compensation that overwhelmingly goes to the executives who are
approving buybacks  which is why the Securities and Exchange
Commission nearly two decades ago started requiring companies to
expense such pay   That s not to say buybacks lack value  Even Buffett
who has been generally critical of stock repurchases  has said they
make sense at the right price  The brave companies  like investors
that bought stock in much of 2009 and 2010 were rewarded  Those were
good investments and most likely better than the ones they could have
made directly into workers or their businesses at the time  On the
other hand  the  770 billion that S P 500 companies spent last year
with stocks near all time highs and falling was likely not prudent
But the regime that Sanders and Schumer propose would only make things
worse  The two senators want to set conditions that would require
companies to invest in their communities and  long term strength  of
their businesses before being able to spend a dollar on buybacks  Even
putting aside the issues of how to measure and monitor whether
companies are investing enough in their workers and long term strength
the senators  proposal misses the mark  The reason companies should
pay their workers more or make capital expenditures is because they
are good or worthy investments   General Electric   NYSE GE  Co   for
instance  has spent  217 billion on capital expenditures since 2000
or nearly  100 billion more than it has put toward buybacks  Given
that GE s market cap has sunk nearly  500 billion in that time  those
capital expenditures look just as ill advised  in retrospect  as its
buybacks  Force companies to spend money on either workers or plants
before they make buybacks  and they will do just that  whether those
investments make sense or not  What s more  by linking buybacks to
minimum wages  Sanders and Schumer would give a further advantage to
companies in industries that naturally pay higher wages  like finance
and tech  by making it relatively easier for them to do buybacks and
boost their stock market returns  This would concentrate even more of
the already lopsided investment in the economy in those two sectors
neither of which are likely the employers of workers that Sanders and
Schumer think of being the most left behind  If the senators want
companies to pay workers more  they have a much more direct way to do
that  raising the minimum wage unshackled from whether a company plans
to buy back stock or not   Sanders and Schumer are right that there is
a problem with buybacks  but it really has to do with information  The
returns from buybacks are often quick and easier to see  Paying higher
wages or buying equipment is a less certain  longer term investment
There should be more information around wages so that investors and
others can see the return on that investment  Companies should not
just have to expense the cost of stock based compensation but disclose
it more prominently  Prohibiting dividends and buybacks financed by
debt could be an avenue worth exploring  There are ways that
Washington can encourage companies to be better long term thinkers and
local citizens  but restricting buybacks alone isn t it",2019-02-04,Bloomberg
50,General Electric sales top Wall Street estimates  shares rally,"By Alwyn Scott and Rachit Vats  Reuters     General Electric   NYSE GE
Co beat estimates for sales and cash flow in the fourth quarter and
said on Thursday it had reached a tentative deal to settle a subprime
mortgage case with U S  regulators  sending its shares sharply higher
GE stock soared nearly 15 percent to  10 45 as profits and sales rose
in its aviation  healthcare and oil and gas businesses  offsetting
nearly  1 billion in cumulative losses at its power and GE Capital
units  Many analysts and investors had braced for disappointing
results and were relieved that new Chief Executive Larry Culp was able
to show some improvement while being blunt about bad news   Culp
offered only a scant forecast  however  saying details would come at a
meeting to be scheduled soon  Investors were largely unfazed   The
only relevant data in the quarterly numbers is that actual sales and
the free cash flow from the industrials business were better than
expected   William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann said   GE also
announced a settlement with the U S  Department of Justice over its
subprime mortgage practices before the 2008 financial crisis  GE will
pay a  1 5 billion civil penalty  which it had already set aside  On a
conference call  Culp ruled out selling GE s  40 billion aircraft
leasing unit  quelling concerns about jettisoning one of the few
profitable parts of GE Capital   While not providing forecasts  Culp
set targets that matched what analysts and investors have been
requesting  lifting GE s triple B credit rating to single A quality
reducing industrial debt and restoring the dividend  Culp did not set
a time frame  GE s lengthy presentation  however  contained numerous
warnings and unknowns  Cash is likely to decline in 2019  but GE would
not say by how much  GE is still in  early innings  of turning around
its power business  where revenue will fall again in 2019  and GE will
provide more detail about its toxic long term care insurance
liabilities in February  after taking a  6 2 billion charge and
setting aside  15 billion to cover premium shortfalls last year   It
also did not provide more detail on ongoing regulatory investigations
of its accounting for long term care policies and power plant services
contracts   The results are better than expected because expectations
were so low   said Erik Gordon  a professor at the University of
Michigan Ross School of Business   The company still faces the huge
challenges of managing its mountain of debt and restoring investor
confidence in the accuracy of its numbers    The 2018 results cap an
exceptionally bad year for GE that began with an  11 billion charge
and disclosure of accounting investigations by U S  regulators  and
end with GE naming an outsider CEO keen to speed up  20 billion in
asset sales and chip away at GE s massive debt  The 127 year old
conglomerate also was booted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average
had its credit ratings cut to three notches above junk  eliminated
executive bonuses  slashed its quarterly dividend to a penny  restated
earnings for the prior two years and saw a  10 billion fossil fuel
power acquisition turn sour as wind and solar power gained momentum
while GE s gas turbine business struggled with faulty turbine blades
GE said its power unit took  400 million in charges in the fourth
quarter to cover blade repairs at dozens of customers around the world
and other costs   GE booked a  666 million profit for the fourth
quarter and revenue rose 5 percent to  33 3 billion  above analyst
estimates of  32 6 billion  according to Refinitiv IBES  Industrial
free cash flow of  4 9 billion in the quarter  while down from last
year  topped the  4 billion threshold that investors were looking to
beat  Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch wrote in a note  He said GE had
liquidated inventory and improved bill collection in renewables  but
it was unclear whether those improvements could continue  GE s ailing
power division lost  872 million in the quarter and its GE Capital
finance arm lost  177 million  it said    GE s profit totaled 8 cents
a share  compared with a loss of  1 29 a share a year ago  On an

decimated shares of  General Electric   NYSE GE  Co are willing to
wait years to reap a solid return but also hope the U S  conglomerate
will show progress in its turnaround plan and avoid more negative
surprises  GE shares  which traded above  32 at the end of 2016  sank
to  6 66 late last year  and remain at levels not seen since the
financial crisis a decade ago  The stock  an original component of the
Dow Jones Industrial Average  was replaced in the blue chip index last
year   The dramatic plunge has lured investors who see worth in GE s
jet engine  healthcare equipment and power turbine businesses and are
confident in new CEO Larry Culp  as shareholders seek to capitalize on
the stock s steep slide    Based on what we believed the business is
worth  it is one of the best investment returns  even on a risk
adjusted basis  that we can find in the large cap space   said Gary
Lenhoff  chief investment officer at Great Lakes Advisors in Chicago
which Lenhoff said was buying GE shares in the second half of last
year and said his timeline was three years  Even those with long term
investment horizons will keenly watch fourth quarter results on
Thursday  GE is trying to restore profitability at the power division
which manufactures and services turbines  The unit is expected to
realize virtually no earnings this year  according to analyst
estimates compiled by Refinitiv    The actions that need to be taken
in the power business   it s not a quick fix  it s not something that
you can achieve in six months   said Michael Kon  portfolio manager
with Golub Group in San Mateo  California   Usually a turnaround of
that magnitude takes a year or two to be complete and you can then
start seeing the fruit of it   Investors will also watch GE s moves to
shore up the balance sheet and reduce debt  including updates on
planned asset sales  They hope GE  which booked billions of dollars in
charges last year  can avoid negative surprises  Daniel Babkes  senior
research analyst at Pzena Investment Management  said GE s stock price
already accounts for some potential negative news  including prolonged
struggles for the power business and dour assumptions for liabilities
Pzena bought GE shares last year  the first time in the value
investment firm s more than 20 year history that it has made a
significant investment in the company s stock   We are in this period
of peak uncertainty   Babkes said   What is particularly attractive
about the investment is not just the fact that the path forward can
look better  it s that none of that is priced in   Graphic  Long road
lower for GE shares    Several investors expressed enthusiasm for Culp
named GE s chief executive officer on Oct 1 with a compensation
package linked to stock price performance  Culp is well regarded for
previously running industrial company Danaher Corp  NYSE DHR   whose
shares soared during his tenure   I think people are probably buying
Larry rather than buying GE at this point   said Graham Copley
industrials and materials analyst at SSR LLC   There is an expectation
that he can make something better than lemonade out of this lemon   GE
shares have rebounded more than 30 percent from their low in December
Yet many remain skeptical  GE is saddled with heavy debt  and income
driven investors have likely been chased away after Culp slashed GE s
quarterly dividend to a penny a share to preserve cash   There are
serious concerns about the GE Capital lending arm and the power
division  GE posted a third quarter loss of  22 8 billion  including a
massive writedown of goodwill from the power business  mainly from its
2015 acquisition of assets from  Alstom   PA ALSO   Granite Investment

53,GE urges speedy fix for power turbine blades  says blade broke in 2015  sources,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK  Reuters     General Electric   NYSE GE  Co is
advising some buyers of its big power turbines to switch out faulty
blades sooner than expected and has disclosed that a blade broke in
2015  according to a presentation reviewed by Reuters and people
briefed on the matter  The second blade break  which has not been
previously reported  involved an earlier turbine model and was similar
to a break last September that severely damaged a turbine in Texas and
shut it down for two months of repairs   The defective blade issue
affects GE s newest turbine technology  which cost billions of dollars
to develop  and is among the challenges facing new Chief Executive
Larry Culp as he tries to revive the profits and share price of the
127 year old conglomerate  GE s advice for fixing the problem can curb
turbine use by utilities  according to the sources and utilities that
use GE turbines  potentially threatening the revenue streams at the
power plants  At private meetings in Florida and London last month  GE
executives said the company is offering extended warranty coverage and
making spare parts available to ease concerns of insurers  lenders and
utilities interested in buying turbines  according to a GE executive s
slideshow presentation and three people who attended the meetings
Some said they signed non disclosure agreements  GE told participants
that turbines with at risk blades should run for fewer than about 7
000 hours depending on individual plant circumstances  before shutting
down for blade replacement  according to two people who attended the
meetings  GE said it had advised customers of the change  GE s
previous guidance for blades was after 25 000 hours  The executives
also said in the meetings that the blade that broke in 2015 at an
undisclosed power plant was in a GE 9FB turbine  which has similar
technology to the HA turbine that broke in Texas  The 2015 break
prompted GE to work on new protective coatings and alter a heat
treatment process for the parts  a second presentation showed   GE
turbine outage data     GE told Reuters that after the blade broke in
2015  GE did not know at first that the problem would also afflict its
HA models   The HA components were in development before the initial
9FB issue occurred  and the HA units began to ship while the root
cause analysis was in process and before it was determined that it was
a component issue that impacted the 9FB fleet and the HA   GE said in
a statement to Reuters  GE declined to provide more detail about the
2015 blade break or usage restrictions  saying some of the information
is proprietary   We are executing the plan we laid out to fix the
blade  issue   GE said in a statement to Reuters   The feedback from
customers has been positive  and they continue to choose the HA  which
remains the fastest growing fleet of advanced technology turbines in
the world today   The details from GE s meetings come as GE is
installing new blades in about 50 9FB and 52 HA turbines  according to
a person familiar with the matter  fewer than the 130 estimated after
the blade break in Texas prompted it to warn that other turbines are
at risk for blade failure  Reuters previously reported that GE found
an oxidation problem  not a break  in 2015 and developed a fix before
the failure in Texas  Scaling back use of GE turbines reduces how much
electricity they produce  a threat to revenues and profits for  Exelon
Corp   NYSE EXC   PSEG Power LLC  Chubu Electric Power Co Inc and
others with the 400 ton GE machines that form the core of modern gas
fired power plants  according to utilities and industry experts  Japan
s Chubu Electric said it learned about the blade problem with its six
new GE turbines last October  It is restricting operation time at one
of the two plants that use GE s HA turbines  but expects to have
enough reserve capacity to generate sufficient electricity to meet
demand during this winter   a spokesman told Reuters  He said Chubu
will tally the financial impact  depending on how long the plants
would be shut down  to replace blades  It expects repairs to be
completed by the end of February  PSEG Power and Exelon  based in the
United States  declined to comment on how restrictions would affect
them  GE is continuing to sell turbines in a slumping market for big
power plants  where it has lost share to rivals Mitsubishi Hitachi
Power Systems and  Siemens  AG  DE SIEGn   GE has said it booked
orders for three large turbines last month  GE s share price fell
after GE revealed a blade issue in Texas on September 19  saying such
teething problems  are not uncommon with new technology and would
require  minor adjustments  to fix  GE has said it would set aside
480 million for repairs and warranty claims  Three days after the
break in Texas became known  Electricite de France SA  PA EDF  shut
down its HA turbine to replace blades  EDF did not respond to requests
for comment  At the London meeting  about 100 insurance industry
people gathered in the oak paneled Old Library room of Lloyd s of
London on December 13  according to the sources  who spoke on
condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information  GE power
executives Marcus Scholz and Tom Dreisbach gave presentations about GE
s turbine technology  In its turbine documentation  GE has advised its
power customers to inspect turbines with so called  Generation 1
blades after 25 000 hours of use  GE said its improved blades  known
as  Generation 2   are designed to last 25 000 hours or more before
being replaced  According to page 11 of his presentation  Dreisbach
said the Generation 1 blade that broke in 2015 failed after 22 000
hours  New parts treated with a special coating were inspected by
technicians after about 12 000 and 16 000 hours and  cracking  was
still observed   the presentation said   GE inspected other turbines

disclose more than  80 million in additional Nissan compensation for
2010 2018 that he had arranged to be paid later  Ghosn  swiftly
dismissed as Nissan chairman after the arrest  has denied wrongdoing
Nissan was also charged by Japanese prosecutors for under reporting
his pay  and has since pledged to overhaul its governance  Bloomberg
earlier reported that the U S  regulator was investigating the company
s disclosures on executive pay  The report  citing sources  said the
SEC is examining whether the company maintained adequate controls to
prevent improper payments and whether lapses by Nissan violated U S
securities law   Separately  the Wall Street Journal reported that the
SEC also sent a request for information to Ghosn  A representative for
Ghosn could not immediately be reached for comment  A Nissan spokesman
confirmed the automaker received an inquiry from the U S  regulator
without giving further details  The SEC was not immediately available
to comment on the matter  Such an SEC inquiry does not mean that

55,U S  Companies to Gain Staunch Defender in Trump DOJ Pick," Bloomberg     President Donald Trump s choice to lead the Justice
Department comes with a track record that signals he could take a
softer stance in policing mergers and promote a more business friendly
approach to prosecutions  William Barr  the nominee for attorney
general  spent 14 years in senior leadership at  Verizon
Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ   and a predecessor  GTE Corp   before
serving as a director at companies including  Time Warner  Inc  NYSE
TWX   and hedge fund firm Och Ziff Capital Management Group  That
experience would make him the first attorney general in decades to
bring an extensive corporate background to the nation s top
prosecutorial post and potentially sets up a sharp turn from former
Attorney General Jeff Sessions  who devoted much of his two year
tenure to cracking down on illegal immigration and opposing the
legalization of marijuana  Barr would join a string of Trump cabinet
heads who are rolling back regulations across the U S  economy  from
telecommunications to the environment  An establishment Republican who
previously served as attorney general under former President George H
W  Bush  Barr begins a two day Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday
The Republican controlled Senate is likely to confirm him  handing him
wide ranging influence over companies through his oversight of merger
reviews  financial fraud and foreign bribery cases  Abuse of Power
Barr has a history of assailing government regulation and corporate
enforcement  At a 2004 conference held by the Federalist Society  a
conservative legal policy group  he accused prosecutors of abusing
their power and overreaching in corporate investigations  Government
lawyers in white collar cases  he argued  are  very young  very
inexperienced and don t have the breadth of judgment that s necessary
Many enforcement agencies  they have a way of avoiding a result in
court  which is just to grind the corporation into dust by continuing
investigations ad nauseam   Barr said  Many enforcement agencies
couldn t win if they took the case to court  he added  but use
investigations  to kill the company with a death of a thousand cuts
Barr  68  would return to the top job at a time when the department is
juggling a number of high profile investigations  including  General
Electric   NYSE GE  Co  s  22 billion accounting charge in its power
equipment unit  allegations of foreign bribery by Airbus SE  and a
years long inquiry into corrupt payment allegations by Walmart  NYSE
WMT  Inc  Its biggest merger investigation is T Mobile US Inc  sc
NASDAQ TMUS  proposed  26 5 billion takeover of Sprint Corp  NYSE S
Hands On Approach   He would be more likely to take a hands on
approach to corporate criminal cases and investigations than his
predecessor   said George Stamboulidis  a former federal prosecutor
and now co chair of the white collar group at Baker   Hostetler LLP in
New York  Given his experience in business and government  Barr will
also likely have a larger say in changes to corporate enforcement
policy  he said  As Bush s attorney general  Barr came under fire for
not appointing an independent prosecutor in a sprawling bank fraud
scandal known as Iraqgate that involved the funneling of funds to that
country  At the time  Barr also oversaw the department s prosecutions
stemming from the savings and loan crisis and a revitalization of
antitrust enforcement following a pullback during the Reagan
administration  Telecom Deals Barr had a front row seat to major
telecom deals after leaving the department  As general counsel at GTE
he worked on the company s sale to Bell Atlantic and fought the merger
of WorldCom and MCI  according to his Senate questionnaire  The GTE
Bell Atlantic deal formed Verizon  where Barr served as general
counsel and worked on Verizon s acquisitions of MCI and Alltel  While
at Verizon  Barr opposed net neutrality rules that prohibited
broadband providers from slowing or blocking internet traffic  arguing
they would deter investments by telephone and cable companies to
improve internet service  Net neutrality regulations were implemented
during the Obama administration and abandoned last year by regulators
under Trump   It threatens the ability to recoup investment and
deprives the network owner of the freedom to compete   Barr said at a
2006 event hosted by the Federalist Society   The proposed regulatory
regime equals a less diverse internet  It means not more but fewer
products  services and players   Consulting Stint Barr s corporate
background  which includes a stint consulting for  BP   LON BP  Plc on
the Gulf of Mexico oil spill  will benefit the department s work  said
George Terwilliger  a lawyer at McGuireWoods LLP in Washington who
served as deputy attorney general under Barr   Understanding how
businesses and major corporations actually work internally is a
helpful perspective when judging the conduct of those kinds of
organizations   he said  Barr also served on Time Warner Inc  s board
of directors when the company was sold to AT T Inc  NYSE T   That
position put him in conflict with the Justice Department s antitrust
chief  Makan Delrahim  who unsuccessfully sued to stop the sale last
year  The Time Warner case marked a radical shift in how the
department polices mergers between companies that operate in different
part of a supply chain  known as vertical deals  The lawsuit was the
first time in decades the government went to trial to stop such a deal
Trump opposed the AT T Time Warner merger  vowing to stop it when he
was a candidate  Time Warner Clash Before the lawsuit was filed  Barr
and Jeff Bewkes  Time Warner s chief executive officer at the time
met with Delrahim and two of his deputies to try to reach a settlement
Barr told them that the antitrust division s model predicting higher
pay TV prices for consumers from the deal  was insubstantial
unrealistic and bore no relationship to how the media and
telecommunications marketplaces actually function   according to a
court filing Barr made in the case  Barr told Senator Amy Klobuchar  a
Minnesota Democrat  that he will recuse himself from the case  which
is pending appeal  Still  his views could signal more openness to
vertical deals in media and telecom industries going forward
according to Dan McInnis  an antitrust lawyer at Thompson Hine LLP in
Washington   It makes it more likely that DOJ s reaction to losing the
AT T case is to soften their position on vertical deals rather than
double down   he said  Barr will have the ultimate say on whether the
department allows T Mobile to buy Sprint or files a lawsuit seeking to
block the merger  The deal would further consolidate the U S  wireless
market by uniting the third  and fourth biggest carriers  Consumer
groups want the government to challenge the deal because they say it
risks raising consumer prices by cutting the number of national
competitors to three from four  Antitrust Enforcement Barr supported
vigorous antitrust enforcement the last time he was attorney general
according to Jim Rill  who led the antitrust division under him  He
supported an initiative to broaden the division s reach overseas
Under the Reagan administration  the department took a position that
it should only be concerned with anticompetitive conduct in foreign
markets that had a direct effect of raising prices for U S  consumers
Barr ditched that position so that antitrust enforcers could target
competitive restrictions overseas that harmed U S  exporters   He was
very supportive of what we were doing   said Rill  now a lawyer at
Baker Botts LLP in Washington   He in no way was critical and no way
tried to say   Slow down    Barr would take over a Justice Department
that s already made several changes under Sessions that make it easier
for companies to avoid criminal charges or massive penalties  Third
Party Payments Sessions  a former senator from Alabama  barred the
department from imposing penalties in corporate cases that required
payments to third parties  Such payments were the crux of multi
billion dollar settlements with Wall Street banks during the Obama
administration over the sale of toxic mortgage bonds that fueled the
2008 financial crisis  During his tenure  the department sought to
prevent multiple agencies from issuing penalties for the same
wrongdoing  It also made it easier for companies to avoid criminal
charges by self reporting potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act  which prohibits payments to foreign officials to obtain
or retain business  Those are policies Barr is likely to continue   He
s not coming at this as being a street prosecutor of drug gangs   said

56,GE drags premier U S  corporate debt  which posts worst year since 2008,"By Kate Duguid NEW YORK  Reuters    The stock market s gyrations have
grabbed the year end headlines  but another key financial market
investment grade U S  corporate debt  is turning in its worst yearly
performance since the financial crisis a decade ago   General Electric
Co s  N GE  securities have weighed on both markets as the 126 year
old conglomerate founded by Thomas Edison has suffered staggering
losses and asset writedowns   GE shares have skidded around 56 percent
in 2018  the fourth biggest decline in the S P 500 Index  SPX   GE s
120 billion of bonds are not down as much  but the securities  which
have long been a staple for fixed income managers around the globe
are among the leading drags on the main indexes tracking the  6
trillion investment grade corporate debt sector  GE s bonds have
crashed by around 14 percent   a monumental underperformance in bond
market terms  Analysts worry this could signal worse times ahead for
investment grade credit overall  According to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index  the sector s total 2018 return is negative 2 5
percent  the largest drop since 2008   U S  companies feasted on low
interest rates in the decade since the crisis  leaving corporate
balance sheets leveraged to the hilt with some  9 1 trillion of debt
almost double the 2007 total of  4 9 trillion  according to Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association   Now the Federal Reserve s
gradual tightening of its easy money policy has investors rethinking
their commitment to these assets  Bonds from dozens of formerly high
quality issuers are already trading as though they were no longer
investment grade  As interest rates rise   the weaker links are going
to be exposed   said Kathleen Gaffney  director of diversified fixed
income at  Eaton   NYSE ETN  Vance  After this year s sharp slide in
GE shares  its debt load now stands at roughly twice its market
capitalization of  63 billion  KEEPING PLENTY OF COMPANY GE s debt is
not alone in the doghouse   Bonds from  Ford Motor Co   N F   AT T
Corp  N T    Kinder Morgan   N KMI   CVS Health  N CVS   General
Motors Co  N GM  and  Verizon Communications   N VZ  also ranked among
the weakest performers as the year wound down  Of the bottom 20
performers  14 were triple B rated  the lowest tier of investment
grade  GE debt has been slashed to BBB  which is just three steps
above junk  and more than a third of GE s bonds are already trading at
junk bond levels  Bonds most likely to be downgraded to junk are
expected to be among the worst performers when the next economic
downturn hits  according to Monica Erickson  portfolio manager of
global developed credit at DoubleLine Capital LP  She noted that
around  3 trillion of triple B bonds are now outstanding  comprising
roughly half of the investment grade market  up from only about 20
percent a decade ago    With the triple B market worth about  3
trillion  finding a buyer in the  1 2 trillion high yield market could
be difficult  in a downturn  she said  Many fund managers are required
to keep only investment grade debt in their portfolios  so they could
be forced to sell at steep discounts if the debt gets downgraded to
junk  Currently  the junk market totals  1 2 trillion  Were GE to lose
investment grade status  those bonds alone would suddenly account for
around 10 percent of the high yield market  Not all triple B credits
will be downgraded in the event of a downturn  however   you will
probably have a larger percentage of this entire  investment grade
market shift into this high yield market than has been the case
historically   Erickson said  HOW MUCH GE DO YOU OWN  GE s new Chief
Executive Officer Larry Culp is battling to restore profits and slash
debt after the company lost  22 8 billion last quarter  mostly from
its ailing power unit  To shore up cash  it has slashed its once fat
quarterly dividend to just a penny per share  and Culp said GE would
proceed with  urgency  on selling assets  Those efforts have so far
fallen short in the eyes of bond holders and credit ratings agencies
In response to a request for comment  a GE spokesperson referred to
Culp s statements in its third quarter earnings report and in recent
media interviews about debt reduction plans  All three major bond
raters have slashed GE s credit ratings twice in the last 13 months
It is now labeled  BBB   by Standard   Poor s  with equivalent ratings
from Moody s and Fitch  Roughly  43 billion worth of GE bonds sport
prices of less than 90 cents on the dollar  with more than  17 5
billion selling for less than 80 cents  The lowest  a  2 billion
perpetual bond sold in 2015  is currently quoted at about 63 cents on
the dollar and now yields 17 5 percent versus its 4 1 percent coupon
rate  By comparison  the average triple B bond yields 4 7 percent
according to BAML index data   The cost to insure GE bonds against
default is near the highest since the financial crisis  Yet the
biggest risk facing bond investors is being unable to sell their
holdings if the company s credit fundamentals worsen    You ve got a
lot of sellers and no buyers   said a GE debt investor who asked not
to be named because of compliance reasons  And so  we have not yet
sold our debt holdings      You ve seen people head toward the exit
and there s not a buyer  so you get a big trade down   the investor
said   Everyone s getting questions from their boss or their client
asking  how much GE do you own",2018-12-30,Reuters
57,ABB relents to activist shareholder and unloads Power Grids unit,"TOKYO ZURICH  Reuters    ABB  S ABBN  will sell a majority stake in
its Power Grids division to Japan s Hitachi  T 6501  and return the
proceeds to shareholders  bowing to pressure from an activist investor
to sell the business that makes transformers and converters  The
acquisition  which values the unit at  11 billion  will see Hitachi
become one of the largest players in the power grid industry  For ABB
which also makes industrial robots  the deal offloads its least
profitable division  allowing it to focus on automation  But the
decision to sell the unit marks a U turn for ABB Chief Executive
Ulrich Spiesshofer  who two years ago insisted on keeping the business
despite calls to sell from shareholders  including Swedish activist
investor Cevian which owns 5 34 percent of ABB   Our shareholders have
been with us for many years  they have been patient and have also had
perseverance with us to see through the transformation   Spiesshofer
said on a call with reporters   Now  we let them participate in the
results of their patience   Cash proceeds of  7 6 7 8 billion from the
deal will be returned to shareholders via buybacks or similar means
ABB said   Shares in ABB were less than 1 percent higher at 0830 GMT
after rising 2 5 percent at the market open  Hitachi shares fell
almost 1 percent  Cevian cofounder Lars Forberg said he was convinced
the sale was the right way forward for ABB    Focusing ABB s portfolio
on digital industries and further simplifying the business creates a
better company and a strong basis for long term growth   he said
Investor AB  ABB s largest investor with 10 7 percent of shares  said
it  fully supports  the transaction  ABB will retain the remainder of
the Power Grids business  with an option to sell to Hitachi after
three years   FINANCIAL BURDEN  ABB s Power Grids business employs 36
000 people and had sales of  10 4 billion last year  It had an
operating profit margin of 10 0 percent in the third quarter  down 60
basis points from a year earlier   The acquisition is Hitachi s
largest ever and will help the Japanese company achieve its goal of
boosting its energy and electricity unit s sales over the next four
years   However  some analysts reacted sceptically  raising concerns
about the financial burden so soon after Hitachi recovered from
massive losses over the last decade by restructuring commoditized
businesses  such as hard disc drives and TV panels   Hitachi must be
better off beefing up its railway or artificial intelligence business
rather than spending on the power business where its rivals such as
General Electric   N GE  and Toshiba Corp  T 6502  have been
struggling   a brokerage analyst said  Following the transaction  ABB
will have four divisions  Electrification  Industrial Automation
Robotics   Discrete Automation  and Motion  which includes motors and
drives    Our four newly shaped businesses  each a global leader  will
be well aligned to the way our customers operate and focus stronger on

59,Exclusive  GE s push to fix power turbine problem goes global,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK  Reuters    Utilities are shutting down at
least 18 of  General Electric  Co s  N GE  newest gas turbines for
repairs at power plants from Taiwan to France  according to more than
a dozen interviews with plant operators and industry experts  The
shutdowns  which follow a recent GE turbine blade failure in Texas
come as GE grapples with financial losses and a drop in orders for the
massive generators that can supply electricity to hundreds of
thousands of homes  GE is setting aside  480 million to repair its 9HA
7HA and 9FB model turbines as it restructures its power business  The
126 year old conglomerate has declined to say how many have been shut
down  or when it would replace parts   if needed   in as many as 130
such turbines it has produced  Power plant operators in Japan  Taiwan
France and at multiple U S  sites have shut down   or plan to shut
down   at least 18 of the 55 new HA model turbines that GE has shipped
so far  French utility data and interviews with more than 20 industry
experts  including executives  plant operators  insurance specialists
engineers and consultants with direct knowledge of GE turbines show
In an interview  GE gas power systems CEO Chuck Nugent played down the
significance of turbine shutdowns and the French data  saying that GE
turbines are performing  extremely well   despite the need for  early
maintenance  to fix the blades  Considering all of the power turbines
it has in use  GE has  the most reliable fleet in the world   99
percent  give or take  reliability   he added  GE previously disclosed
that its equipment needing blade repairs includes four 7HA turbines in
Texas that were shut after oxidation caused a blade to fail in one of
them in September  Those turbines are included in the 18 being shut
down  Photographs of the damaged turbine reviewed by Reuters show
dozens of jagged and broken blades inside the massive machine  owned
by  Exelon Corp   N EXC   The turbines are now running after two
months of repairs  Exelon said  GE told Reuters it identified the
oxidation problem in 2015  and developed a fix before the failure in
Texas  The fix uses an earlier casting method that was employed on
other turbine models  Three plant operators using GE equipment that
are shutting for blade repairs  Invenergy  Exelon and Tennessee Valley
Authority  told Reuters GE has been transparent and responsive in
installing new blades for free under warranty   Overall  we ve been
very pleased with GE s HA technology and its performance capabilities
said Beth Conley  a spokeswoman at Invenergy  which is receiving
replacement blades for three new HA turbines at a Pennsylvania plant
that has not yet opened  Following the problems in Texas  state owned
utility Electricite de France  PA EDF  closed its plant in the
northern French town of Bouchain for a month starting in late
September for blade replacements  Bouchain was the first plant
worldwide to install GE s 9HA turbine  Bouchain has logged 86 outages
for equipment failure  testing or other reasons from January 2017 to
October 2018  five times the average for non GE plants  according to
data from French grid operator RTE analyzed by Reuters  Reuters
excluded outages for planned maintenance  The French data also show
that plants with GE turbines have closed for repairs or testing  on
average  more than twice as often as non GE gas fueled plants in
France with turbines made by  Alstom   PA ALSO    Siemens  AG  DE
SIEGn  and Ansaldo Energia SpA  GE acquired Alstom s power business in
2015  For a graphic  click  GE and EDF officials told Reuters that the
data from grid operator RTE  an independent subsidiary of EDF  are
not wrong   but should not be used to assess turbine performance
because some outages might be due to other equipment at the plants
EDF said there are no problems at Bouchain  which opened in 2016  and
that frequent shutdowns are not unusual for new plants during their
break in period  EDF said Bouchain s output is cycled up and down to
meet peaks in electricity demand rather than running constantly  The
other gas fired plants tracked by RTE also can be used for peaking and
have been in operation for many years  RTE  Siemens AG  DE SIEGn
Ansaldo Energia SpA and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems  T 7011
declined to comment  Reuters could not obtain comparable data on how
often GE s turbines shut down for repair at utilities around the world
Shutdowns are triggered when utilities determine that a plant needs to
be serviced or tested  or when equipment failure or other problems
cause the plant to shut down unexpectedly  While GE plants still
produce a third of the world s electricity  GE fell from first to
third place in new turbine orders by capacity  behind Mitsubishi and
Siemens  according to a first half tally by McCoy Power Reports  a
widely watched industry data source  GE said it booked seven HA
turbine orders in the first nine months of this year  half as many as
in the same period last year  GE s HA turbines have come under
particular pressure and its plant repair business is facing growing
competition  The success of GE s new turbines are of increasing
importance as it slims down to focus on power plants  jet engines and
wind turbines in a flurry of restructuring  GE spent more than two
decades developing the 400 ton machines  but brought them to market
after rivals Siemens and Mitsubishi were gaining market share  forcing
GE to catch up  GE undercut its rivals  prices by about 20 percent  to
go from 0 percent to about 45 percent share of this turbine class by
2016    Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  analysts said in a report this year
Now Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp is battling to restore GE s
profit and slash debt after the company lost  22 8 billion last
quarter  mostly from its power unit  and its credit rating fell to
just three notches above junk  Culp is splitting up the power division
consolidating its power headquarters to cut costs and has named new
leaders for it  Demand for large gas turbines is at a 23 year low
forcing GE and rivals to fight hard for fewer deals as utilities buy
more wind and solar systems that have become cost competitive  Scott
Strazik  the new chief executive of GE Gas Power  said in an interview
that customers are happy with GE s response to the blade issue and GE
has no plans to change how it handles customer issues  or how it tests
turbines  noting GE s test facility is the largest and most
comprehensive in the world    The HA is the fastest selling gas
turbine that we have  and customers continue to have a strong desire
for the HA   Strazik said",2018-12-07,Reuters
60,Fed urged to get more serious about U S  corporate debt risks,"By Jonathan Spicer and Howard Schneider NEW YORK ST  LOUIS  Reuters
Bankers  executives and investors are warning Federal Reserve
officials behind closed doors that record leveraged lending to
companies from lightly regulated corners of Wall Street could make any
economic downturn harder to manage   With the second longest U S
expansion in its advanced stages  the worry is that a key part of the
credit market could be particularly vulnerable to a slowdown  as
highly indebted companies face a greater risk of default  Some of
those involved in the debate who spoke to Reuters expressed
frustration that the Fed is not taking the risk seriously enough
There is a sense at the Fed that it needs to watch this area
leveraged credit  but it s still in the infancy and it s unclear how
far will it go   said an economist familiar with the Fed s efforts
In a worst case scenario that would faintly echo the financial crisis
a decade ago  the defaults could worsen any downturn by destabilizing
big non bank lenders  such as private equity firms and hedge funds
and hitting employment across U S  industries  Leveraged loans are
typically made to already indebted firms with low credit ratings  and
the concern is that the loans would be difficult to either collect or
resell in a downturn  putting both the borrower and lender at risk
Just the sheer size of market based credit intermediation is very
different  from years past  and we don t quite know how that is going
to behave in a downturn   Tobias Adrian  director of the monetary and
capital markets department at the International Monetary Fund  said in
an interview   Few believe leveraged loans today would set off a
crisis similar to the one triggered by a wave of defaults in the U S
subprime mortgage market in 2008  since they are focused on a smaller
part of the economy than the sprawling housing market  They do
however  risk handcuffing companies and lenders trying to react to a
downturn  possibly making it more painful  The Fed on Wednesday is due
to publish for the first time a new semiannual report on financial
stability  analyzing conditions in different corners of the financial
system including leveraged lending  HOT TOPIC The central bank itself
may have contributed to the ballooning  1 12 trillion U S  leveraged
loan market by holding interest rates near zero for seven years in the
wake of the recession to encourage lending and investment  By
comparison  collateralized debt obligations  or CDOs  which spread
toxic housing debt through the world s financial system  was worth
some  61 trillion globally in 2007  according to the Bank for
International Settlements  The total leveraged loan market is now
about double what it was in 2008  and it has grown 17 percent so far
this year  based on the S P LSTA Leveraged Loan Index   A record 59
percent of those  junk  loans are rated B  or worse  according to S P
Global  NYSE SPGI    Risks attributable from this debt binge are
significant   it said last month   Graphic    According to Fed
policymakers who spoke to Reuters  those who have spoken to central
bankers  and minutes of recent meetings of the Federal Advisory
Council  private discussions increasingly center on the growth of
leveraged credit and the risk it poses to overall financial stability
The council is made of bankers appointed from the Fed s 12 regional
districts to consult with the central bank  For example  some regional
Fed presidents have asked corporate chief executives whether they are
seeing leveraged loans use debt structures that would appear
particularly dangerous in a credit crunch  Loans that have to be
renewed and refunded frequently  for example  might belong in that
category   In Washington  one banker on the advisory council told Fed
governors that non regulated lenders were  driving aggressive
structures  and cutting out heavily regulated banks  according to the
minutes of a September advisory council meeting    SO EXTREME  Scott
Minerd  managing partner at Guggenheim Partners  said President John
Williams  NYSE WMB  and some of his colleagues at the New York Fed
were  taken aback  when he told an advisory meeting that he did not
think the Fed could safely avoid a messy recession in the face of the
credit build up and other risks   Because it is now so extreme  any
attempt to rein in credit expansion is going to ultimately blow up
Minerd said at the Reuters Global Investment 2019 Outlook Summit this
month  Credit spreads   or the difference between government and
corporate borrowing costs   have already widened to a two year high
for both investment grade and high yield debt  In what could be a
taste of things to come   General Electric  Co s  N GE  bonds tumbled
this month as it scrambled to raise cash   nL4N1XO4MT   Minerd said
the Fed and other regulators did not yet seriously consider a scenario
in which credit spreads would rise much further prompting regulators
to force liquidations at insurers and other firms that had bought so
called collateralized loan obligations  or CLOs  Like the CDOs behind
the housing crisis  CLOs bundle corporate loans into a single security
They don t really have a good handle on where this risk lives   he
said   For example  one question where regulators and bankers have
little clarity is who supplies the money that non bank lenders are
pouring into leveraged loans  The central bank has been paying more
attention to elevated leveraged loans this year  with Fed Chair Jerome
Powell telling a public forum earlier this month   There is some
significant corporate borrowing and we have our eyes on that   But
Powell stressed that risks were  pretty moderate  when viewed through
a broader lens that includes asset prices  bank leverage and household
and business borrowing   St  Louis Fed President James Bullard echoed
that sentiment this week  Bullard told Reuters in an interview the
bursting of the tech bubble at the turn of the century was a more
fitting point of reference for corporate debt markets today  rather
than the housing market around 2007  because it was a case where
individual investors were at risk but not the economy as whole   The
first one blew up without major macroeconomic consequences    For the
most part investors licked their wounds and went home  That is a case
where you let markets work   Bullard said",2018-11-27,Reuters
61,General Electric seeks urgent asset sales as bond fears rise,"By Alwyn Scott and Kate Duguid NEW YORK  Reuters     General Electric
Co  N GE  will sell assets with  urgency  to reduce its high debt
Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said on Monday  as GE shares
tumbled as much as 10 percent and the cost of insuring its debt hit a
six year high  Culp is facing tough questions about GE s financial
strength and profit outlook after being named CEO on Oct  1 with a
mandate to turn around the 126 year old conglomerate   We have no
higher priority right now than bringing leverage levels down   Culp
told CNBC   We have plenty of opportunity to do that through asset
sales   Culp said GE also was trying to get  a better grounding in
reality  in its ailing power unit  Last month  GE posted a quarterly
loss of  22 8 billion  cut its annual dividend to just 4 cents a share
and told investors it was facing a deepening federal accounting probe
The power unit lost  631 million in the quarter and GE wrote down  22
billion in goodwill because expected future profits in the unit now
appear unlikely   Since then  some analysts have questioned GE s
liquidity and slashed their target prices for the stock  Culp said he
thought the power business was  getting close  to bottoming out after
more than a year of declining revenue and profit   Some GE bonds are
now trading far below par  and its five year credit default swap rose
to a bid price of 176 5 basis points and the upfront price   to 3 4
percent on Monday  according to data from IHS Markit and Refinitiv
The spike in credit default swap costs comes as short positions in GE
debt have risen to  958 million from  238 million in December 2017
The most shorted debt security is the 5 percent perpetual bond
369604BQ5    which has no maturity date  and has seen short positions
more than double to  442 million from mid September  Analysts at
Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  and CFRA cut price their stock targets
prices on Monday from  12 to  10 and  9  respectively  citing
uncertainly about GE s earnings and margins  and potential liabilities
and writedowns at its insurance and power units  JPMorgan  NYSE JPM
analyst Stephen Tusa last week cut his target to  6 from  10   We do
not think the stock  works  until confidence is restored   Credit
Suisse analyst John Walsh wrote on Monday  GE shares closed down 6 9
percent at  7 99 on the New York Stock Exchange after falling as low
as  7 72  GE had  114 billion in debt at the end of the third quarter
3 7 times its equity and more than four times the industry average
debt to equity ratio of 0 77  Refinitiv data shows  High debt levels
can increase a company s risk of default  Former GE CEO John Flannery
announced  20 billion in planned asset sales a year ago  but many are
either still in the works or have not yielded enough cash to bring
debt in line with peers   GE s largest deal so far  merging its
railroad locomotive unit with Wabtec Corp  N WAB   netted just  2 9
billion in proceeds and 9 9 percent of the combined company   Culp
said GE was considering potential deals involving its  crown jewel
aviation unit  which shares technology with power  but such moves were
not a high priority     We wouldn t say  no  for all time to various
options   but breaking the unit out  monetizing it or raising equity
were  not high on our list  of strategic moves  Culp said",2018-11-12,Reuters
62,U S  companies team up with hospitals to reduce employee maternity costs,"By Jilian Mincer NEW YORK  Reuters     General Electric  Co  N GE  and
other large companies are trying to chip away at rising childbirth
costs for U S  employees  working directly with hospitals to reduce
cesarean sections and related complications  The efforts are in very
early stages  with few details on their impact outside of cost savings
of a few million dollars so far  But they illustrate yet another path
companies are taking to bring down U S  medical costs by working with
doctors and hospitals to set health goals  GE s maternity strategy is
designed to steer its employees to hospitals that are believed to
provide better care and less likely to recommend unnecessary and
costly interventions  company officials told Reuters  U S  employer
spending on maternity care rose 50 percent in the last decade  fueled
by a jump in C section rates despite years of efforts to curb the
practice  according to research firm Truven Health Analytics  For a
graphic  see    Maternity is one of the main drivers of high cost
claims   for employers  said Ellen Kelsay  chief strategy officer at
the National Business Group on Health  Avoiding unnecessary C sections
and minimizing complications  decreases turnover in the workforce
following the birth of a child   she said   General Motors Co  N GM
said it has included maternity goals  including reducing C sections
in a new contract with a Detroit area hospital   Dow Chemical   NYSE
DOW  demanded explanations from hospitals that care for its employees
when its C section rate hit 44 percent several years ago  Now part of
the merged company DowDuPont Inc  N DWDP   it is working on new
payment agreements with doctors and administrators   We went to them
and said how do you explain this   said Steve Morgenstern  Dow
Chemical s North American Health and Insurance Plan Leader  who called
the rate  unacceptable            BUNDLED  PAYMENTS TO CUT COSTS   GE
launched its Maternity Care Select Program in Cincinnati  Ohio  home
to its aviation business  where nearly 300 babies are born to employee
families every year   Local hospital system TriHealth agreed to a
single  bundled  payment rate to care for low and moderate risk
mothers from the start of pregnancy until 90 days after the baby is
born  rather than charge for each visit and delivery separately  That
typically removes the financial upside for C sections  which cost
nearly 60 percent more  on average  than a regular delivery   Adam
Malinoski  GE s manager of health services  said none of the company s
health insurers offered bundled payments on maternity care when it
designed its program  so it decided to work directly with providers
GE pays the out of pocket costs for women who enroll  saving them up
to several thousand dollars  TriHealth and GE would not disclose the
bundled payment rates or how they compare with other hospital rates
New deliveries under GE s program began in 2016  when only 78 pregnant
women enrolled  In 2017  136 women enrolled  TriHealth told Reuters  C
section rates for first time  low risk deliveries  which represent a
small group within the program  dropped to about 6 percent in 2017
from 24 percent in 2016  That comes in well below the U S  rate of 26
percent for low risk births   TriHealth would not disclose the C
section rate for the total group   GE expanded the program to
hospitals in Wisconsin  South Carolina and Massachusetts in 2017 and
announced a fifth location in New York in August  but says it is too
early to provide data for other locations   GE executives said the
program so far has saved the company nearly  2 million because of
lower negotiated fees for maternity care  It represents a fraction of
its spending on the 113 000 employees and family members enrolled in
the GE health insurance plan  but a step in the right direction  they
added    WE WERE SHOCKED  The rise of C sections has been fueled in
part by fears about malpractice litigation  as well as expecting
mothers with health issues or who are older  which raise the risk of
complications  Hospitals say that makes them reluctant to set
maternity goals  The Stanford Health Care medical system works
directly with employers on health targets  such as diabetes care  but
has so far refused to set specific goals on C sections       In such
higher risk cases   it s entirely appropriate and  there s  no way to
determine upfront  who will need a cesarean  said John Jackson  who
handles corporate health partnerships at Stanford Health Care  Suzanne
Delbanco  executive director of the nonprofit Catalyst for Payment
Reform  has worked with large employers seeking to reduce C section
rates  But some companies  are still leery about wading in too much
she said   They don t want to alienate people  they don t want to be
accused of being Big Brother   GM is taking its own shot at lowering
costs and improving care with a new health program  announced in
August  that was created directly with Henry Ford Health System in
Michigan   Three of the program s 19 health metrics involve maternity
care such as lowering C section rates  the company told Reuters
The automaker s total C section rates vary widely  from about 40
percent in the Dallas Fort Worth area to 30 percent or lower in
Detroit                 We were shocked   said Sheila Savageau  U S

63,Trump Xi Trade Deal Likely to Begin Rather Than End at G 20," Bloomberg     President Donald Trump often seems to be caught between
his ideological desire to rewrite America s trade relationship with
China and a businessman s instinct to cut a deal  And with midterm
elections looming and financial markets coming off a rough October
the deal maker appears to have the upper hand   We ll make a deal with
China  and I think it will be a very fair deal for everybody   Trump
told reporters on Friday after asking aides the day before to begin
drafting ideas for an agreement to take to his planned meeting with
Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina
Nov  30 to Dec  1  The two sides are  getting much closer to doing
something   he said  Still  to satisfy Trump s own inner ideologue
and the China hawks in his administration    that  something  is going
to have to hang on substance  And that s where things are likely to
get complicated  Temporary Truce Xi may fill out the picture on Monday
when he is due to address a trade fair in Shanghai  Analysts familiar
with White House discussions  however  say any deal struck at the G 20
is likely to take the form more of a temporary truce than anything
that will bring a final peace in the trade wars  Such a ceasefire
could  they said  see a commitment to forgo additional tariffs  and
possibly even to remove some  while high level officials negotiate a
broader pact  Any of those things would in the current context be a
significant achievement and be welcomed by markets  But they would
also leave Beijing and Washington facing arduous negotiations ahead
as one senior administration official indicated on Friday   If there s
goodwill and agreement  at least personal agreement between the two
presidents of the two biggest economies  we ll move forward after it
and try to work with the Chinese on details   Larry Kudlow  the head
of Trump s National Economic Council  told a conference in Chicago  On
Sunday  Kudlow told Fox News he had a  long talk about the China
position  with Trump on Saturday  including Beijing s weakening
economy  and that the president believes China would like a deal   If
they respond to our asks  then the president will consider making a
deal  as long as it s in America s interests   Kudlow said on  Sunday
Morning Futures   Still  even if conversations go well between Trump
and Xi in Buenos Aires  Kudlow said in Chicago   it will still be a
long  tough process   The reason for that  analysts argue  is that the
structural and economic complaints Washington has with Beijing are far
more consequential than those the U S  is confronting with any other
trading partner  If anything  the Trump administration has also been
embarking on a more confrontational path with China of late  with
recent speeches and comments by officials such as Vice President Mike
Pence causing rumblings of a new Cold War   The distance between a
leaders  statement that they would like to work something out and
would like to make some progress and actually reaching a deal is
ginormous   said Scott Kennedy  an expert on U S  China relations at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington
Economic Aggression  As the diplomacy sputters along  the economic
evidence Trump uses to support his case for a domestic audience is
mounting  U S  Commerce Department data released Friday showed the U S
goods trade gap with China has continued to rise  hitting  301 billion
in the first nine months of 2018  That s an increase of almost 10
percent from the same period last year  That is almost three times the
deficit with the European Union and six times the size of the
imbalance with Japan  two other economies the Trump administration is
now embarking on trade talks with  The Trump administration has also
repeatedly labeled industrial policies such as Beijing s  Made in
China 2025  plan to lead the world in areas such as robotics acts of
economic aggression  meant to undermine America s place in the global
economy  Abandoning    or even weakening    the state subsidies and
other incentives behind that plan is a concession Xi is unlikely to
make  analysts said  Likewise  leadership in Beijing is unlikely to
respond favorably to U S  demands for it to dismantle the network of
state owned firms that control much of the Chinese economy
Intellectual Property One possible area of progress is protecting
intellectual property  with Beijing potentially agreeing to do more to
rein in hackers or to cooperate with U S  authorities who have
intensified a crackdown on Chinese theft of trade secrets  Washington
this week restricted U S  businesses from selling to China s Fujian
Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co   saying the chipmaker poses a threat to
national security  Last month it secured the extradition from Belgium
of a Chinese agent accused of stealing trade secrets from companies
including  General Electric   NYSE GE  Co  But making the sort of
meaningful long term changes to Chinese economic policy that
Washington has been demanding is likely to be far more difficult for
Beijing  analysts said   It is difficult to see what sort of
commitments China could credibly make to address concerns that the U S
has about a host of complicated issues  like how to address  Made in
China 2025   said Eswar Prasad  a former China expert at the
International Monetary Fund who is now at Cornell University  Yet
hardline members of Trump s administration see these as existential
issues in the long term economic conflict between the U S  and China
Chinese analysts  meanwhile  say officials in Beijing continue to feel
burned by their past experience in dealing with the Trump
administration  which as recently as May appeared close to another
deal with Beijing  Zhou Xiaoming  a former commerce ministry official
and diplomat  said one fear in Beijing was that the Trump
administration would continue to demand changes that Xi could never
agree to  If China can t meet those demands  the U S   will kick the
ball back to China and hold China accountable for the fruitless
negotiations   Zhou said   Updates with Kudlow comments from seventh

64,China s Xi promises to raise imports amid trade row with U S ,"By Michael Martina and Winni Zhou SHANGHAI  Reuters    Chinese
President Xi Jinping promised on Monday to lower tariffs  broaden
market access and import more from overseas at the start of a trade
expo designed to demonstrate goodwill amid mounting frictions with the
United States and others  The Nov  5 10 China International Import
Expo  or CIIE  brings thousands of foreign companies together with
Chinese buyers in a bid to demonstrate the importing potential of the
world s second biggest economy  In a speech that largely echoed
previous promises  Xi said China would accelerate opening of the
education  telecommunications and cultural sectors  while protecting
foreign companies  interests and punishing violations of intellectual
property rights  He also said he expects China to import  30 trillion
worth of goods and  10 trillion worth of services in the next 15 years
Last year  Xi estimated that China would import  24 trillion worth of
goods over the coming 15 years   CIIE is a major initiative by China
to pro actively open up its market to the world   Xi said  U S
President Donald Trump has railed against China for what he sees as
intellectual property theft  entry barriers to U S  business and a
gaping trade deficit   Foreign business groups  too  have grown weary
of Chinese reform promises  and while opposing Trump s tariffs  have
longed warned that China would invite retaliation if it didn t match
the openness of its trading partners  Xi said the expo showed China s
desire to support global free trade  adding   without mentioning the
United States   that countries must oppose protectionism  He said
multilateralism and the free trade system is under attack  factors of
instability and uncertainty are numerous  and risks and obstacles are
increasing    With the deepening development today of economic
globalisation   the weak falling prey to the strong  and  winner takes
all  are dead end alleys   he said  Louis Kuijs  head of Asia
economics at Oxford Economics  said the speech was meaningful  if
short on fresh initiatives   I don t think that there were necessarily
path breaking new reforms announced by him today  but I guess I would
take this as a confirmation that China is very keen to be seen as
continuing to open up further and committing to that stance   he said
China imported  1 84 trillion of goods in 2017  up 16 percent  or  255
billion  from a year earlier  Of that total  China imported about  130
billion of goods from the United States  The Chinese government s top
diplomat  State Councillor Wang Yi  said in March that China would
import  8 trillion of goods in the next five years  FOCUS ON G20
Expectations had been low that Xi would announce bold new policies of
the kind that many foreign governments and businesses have been
seeking  The European Union  which shares U S  concerns over China s
trade practices if not Trump s tariff strategy to address them  on
Thursday called on China to take concrete steps to further open its
market to foreign firms and provide a level playing field  adding that
it would not sign up to any political statement at the forum  With
little in the way of fresh policies from Xi on Monday  all eyes now
turn to an expected meeting between him and Trump at the G20 summit in
Argentina at the end of the month   It seems like what  Xi  is
actually doing is saving up all of his goodies to trade away with
Trump as opposed to doing anything unilateral   said Scott Kennedy  a
Chinese economic expert at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies   Now everything is focused on the G20   Trump has said that
if a deal is not made with China  he could impose tariffs on another
267 billion of Chinese imports into the United States  In a sign the
trade row is starting to bite  export orders to the United States
recorded during China s biggest trade show  the Canton Fair in October
dropped 30 3 percent from a year earlier by value  the fair s

ministers from 17 countries were set to attend the expo  ranging from
Russia and Pakistan to the Cook Islands  though none from major
Western nations  Government ministers from several other countries

Swiss President Alain Berset did not make the trip to China  despite
being announced as among attendees by China s foreign ministry last
week  The Swiss government said in a statement to Reuters on Sunday
that his visit had never been confirmed  Some Western diplomats and
businesses have been quietly critical of the expo  arguing it is
window dressing to what they see as Beijing s long standing trade
abuses  Exhibitors from around 140 countries and regions will be on

10 China International Import Expo  or CIIE  is an attempt by Beijing
to counter mounting criticism of its trade and business practices by
bringing thousands of foreign companies together with Chinese buyers
to demonstrate the importing potential of the world s no 2 economy  At
its core  the event is symbolic   When Chinese President Xi Jinping
opens the expo with a speech on Monday morning  few expect him to
announce bold new policies of the kind that many foreign governments
and businesses have been seeking  Instead  people involved in planning
meetings have said they expect state owned companies to arrive with
orders to do deals  possibly even with quotas  so that the expo will
end with China something to show the world  No officials from the
United States    China s top trading partner    will be present as
their trade dispute rages  but over 100 U S  firms will be exhibiting
their wares  With political pressure to deliver  some deals are likely
to be toothless memoranda while others will re hash previous orders
executives and diplomats say  Qatargas and China s CNPC  for example
are expected to sign a supply contract that formalizes a billion deal
agreed in September  according to an energy executive with direct
knowledge of the matter   It s a protocol signing  to show support to
the trade fair   said the executive  The long term contract is worth
roughly  39 billion based on current spot market prices  CNPC is also
expected to sign at the expo an oil supply deal for 2019 with Saudi
Aramco  a regular deal the parties normally review and renew annually
around November  said the executive  Both CNPC and Qatargas did not
immediately respond to request for comment  A similar agreement is
likely from state owned China National Chemicals Corp  or ChemChina
for one of its annual crude oil and refined fuel agreements  said a
separate trading executive with knowledge of the matter  BIG DEAL
Presidents or prime ministers from 18 countries are traveling to
Shanghai for the event  ranging from Russia and Pakistan to the Cook
Islands  though none from major Western nations  Government ministers
from several other countries are also coming  The European Union
meanwhile  pressed China to take concrete steps to further open its
market to foreign firms and provide a level playing field  Several
roads in Shanghai have been repaved ahead of the event  and security
has been beefed up  Some Western diplomats and businesses have been
quietly critical of whole idea of the expo  which they see as a
propaganda stunt   Here are all of these foreigners bringing their
spices for the emperor   said one person  But Xu Bin  a professor of
economics and finance at the China Europe International Business
School in Shanghai  said he thinks China s leaders have come to
realize this year they may ultimately be unable to appease all
concerns   I think Xi Jinping would not expect any positive reaction
from Western countries this time  or in the near future   he said
But he still wants to do it to show the relatively poor countries and
even rich countries that  look  you know  we are going to buy these
things from the world  Do you want a share   Exhibitors from around
140 countries and regions will be on hand  including 404 from Japan

more  but at a practical level  companies that don t have China
experience may be in for a shock  said a Latin American diplomat

66,General Electric reveals deeper regulatory probe  restructuring,"By Alwyn Scott and Rachit Vats  Reuters     General Electric   NYSE GE
Co slashed its quarterly dividend to a penny a share  promised to
restructure its power unit and said it faced a deeper accounting probe
as new Chief Executive Larry Culp took his first steps to revive the
struggling conglomerate  GE said the U S  Securities and Exchange
Commission and Department of Justice had expanded ongoing
investigations to include a  22 billion writedown of goodwill from GE
s power division  which GE reported on Tuesday  GE s restructuring of
Power comes as the 126 year old company  once the most valuable U S
corporation  is reeling from missteps that have eroded profits and
forced it to announce more than  40 billion in writedowns in less than
a year  among the largest such actions in U S  corporate history  Culp
who took over on Oct  1  delivered more bad news on Tuesday  GE will
significantly miss its full year cash flow target of about  6 billion
and cannot estimate profits for the year until Culp gets more detail
about its ailing power unit   GE all but eliminated its quarterly
dividend of 12 cents a share to conserve  3 9 billion in cash
Analysts viewed that positively  and Culp said there were no plans to
raise equity capital  as some analysts had feared   My priorities in
my first 100 days are positioning our businesses to win  starting with
Power  and accelerating deleveraging   Culp said in the results
statement   GE shares were down 8 5 percent at  10 21  They had been
up earlier after the results  NEW POWER STRUCTURE Former CEO John
Flannery  who was on the job for just 14 months  said in June that GE
would pare its focus to jet engines  power plants and renewable energy
by disposing of its healthcare and Baker Hughes units  along with
other restructuring already in the works  Culp added on Tuesday that
GE will put its gas turbine equipment and services businesses in a new
unit  a move analysts said likely foreshadows the sale of other power
assets  such as steam turbines  nuclear plants and power grids  GE
took on much of that capability in 2015 with a  10 billion acquisition
of power assets from  Alstom   PA ALSO  SA  It argued it could boost
margins and profits  But profits fell as demand for fossil power
plants slowed in response to cheaper solar and wind systems  Power
services faced stiff competition in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere  and
use of large power plants has declined  slowing repair revenue  GE
wrote down  22 billion in goodwill because the promised profits from
power are now unlikely   They are acknowledging that it is not going
to turn around in a hurry   said Paul Healy  a professor at the
Harvard Business School who focuses on corporate financial reporting
Largely as a result  GE reported a loss of  22 8 billion for the third
quarter on Tuesday  The power business lost  631 million in the
quarter  Overall  GE posted a loss of  2 63 a share  compared with 16
cents profit a year ago  on a 4 percent revenue decline to  29 6
billion  Adjusted earnings were 14 cents a share  down from 21 cents a
year ago  Analysts had expected 20 cents a share  according to
Refinitiv data  Orders at the power division fell 18 percent and
revenue fell 33 percent in the quarter   The only way out of this mess
is to restructure power   said Scott Davis  analyst at Melius Research
in New York   It will bottom eventually   GE did not cut its earnings
forecast for the year from the most recent  1 00 to  1 07 per share
as some had expected  Analysts have cut estimates for adjusted
earnings to 88 cents a share  on average  according to Refinitiv data
A spokeswoman said GE would not hit the old targets  but was not
providing new ones just yet   I just don t think Larry has his hands
around this fully yet  enough to put his stamp of approval on guidance
Davis said   Credit agencies have since cut GE s ratings  increasing
its debt costs  and its financial challenges  which have prompted talk
that it will issue stock to raise capital  limit the funds GE has to
fix its power division  according to analysts",2018-10-30,Reuters
67,Saudi Arabia s legal revamp offers hope for cautious investors,"By Andrew Torchia RIYADH  Reuters    Saudi Arabia s first
comprehensive bankruptcy law went into effect last month  one of many
reforms to the legal system that economists say may be more important
in the long run than high profile privatizations  Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman s Vision 2030 push to diversify the economy away
from oil has grabbed attention for its big ticket initiatives  such as
a  500 billion business zone and a plan  now shelved  to sell part of
the state oil firm  The legal reforms have attracted less media
coverage because they are highly technical  but they are extensive
ranging from new laws to the creation of courts and training of judges
and they have accelerated over the past couple of years  The new
bankruptcy law creates a clear way for struggling companies to obtain
relief from creditors while they restructure    or for firms to be
liquidated    and may free up billions of dollars now frozen in debt
disputes  There are still concerns about the legal system  highlighted
by the detentions of top Saudi businessmen and officials in a
corruption crackdown last year  but the reforms are changing the
playing field for companies   While the headline setting Vision 2030
continues to be the face of change in Saudi Arabia  the driving force
behind it remains the tangible and impactful modifications done to
local laws and regulations that drive investment   said Bruce
McAlister  a general counsel for industrial conglomerate GE  N GE   a
top foreign investor  He cited the bankruptcy law  new laws on
government private sector partnerships  and rules allowing 100 percent
foreign ownership of trading firms   The legal reform process is
progressing  It s a work in progress and it will take more time  but
the environment is clearly changing   said Grahame Nelson  head of the
Riyadh office of Al Tamimi   Co  New foreign direct investment in
Saudi Arabia totaled just  1 4 billion in 2017  below smaller
countries in the region such as Oman  Privately  businessmen have said
that in addition to low oil prices  the unpredictable legal system
swayed their decisions  SHARIA COMPLIANT For decades  Saudi Arabia did
little to develop its commercial law because it depended heavily on
state led investment in the oil industry  Also  the legal system is
based on sharia  a set of Islamic principles that stresses the idea of
fairness and gives little weight to legal precedent  many foreign
firms come from a common law tradition where precedent is important
The reforms don t change the religious basis of the system  but they
aim to make commercial matters smoother and more predictable with new
institutions and procedures  For example  a committee of experts will
oversee bankruptcy cases  This could eventually speed the resolution
of long running disputes such as a  22 billion  nine year old impasse
over debts left by collapsed Saad Group and Ahmad Hamad al Gosaibi
Bros Co  bankers say  Tim Callen  International Monetary Fund mission
chief to Saudi Arabia  said its forecast for non oil economic growth
to accelerate from 1 1 percent last year to over 3 percent early next
decade was based partly on the legal reforms  Specialized commercial
courts and appeal chambers were established last year  with judges
trained to handle specific types of business dispute  In 2016 the
Saudi Center for Commercial Arbitration  SCCA  opened  offering the
services of about 125 arbitrators working in 11 languages  Hamed Hasan
Merah  the center s chief executive  said it was meeting the biggest
Saudi and foreign companies to persuade them to include recourse to
SCCA arbitration in their contracts  ENFORCEMENT Such efforts aim to
improve commercial judgments within Saudi Arabia  Other reforms seek
to reassure foreign firms by connecting the country more closely to
the legal system abroad  In the past  Saudi courts rarely enforced the
judgments of foreign courts and arbitration centers against Saudi
companies  This has been changing  the country received 163
applications to enforce foreign judgments worth  667 million last year
Among several successful applications in recent months  a Riyadh court
enforced a U S  ruling for a Saudi tourism firm to pay  3 8 million
and a Jeddah court ordered a Saudi miner to pay a Chinese firm  10 1
million  the Justice Ministry said without naming the firms
Authorities have also started to use a 2013 enforcement law that gives
judges less room to use their discretion  so foreign firms seeking
restitution may now get a result in a few months  said Glenn Lovell
partner in Riyadh for lawyers Clyde   Co  Concern over the Saudi legal
system has not disappeared  Much depends on how quickly and
consistently courts can implement new laws  the bankruptcy legislation
has not yet been tested in practice  for example  Many remaining
worries for foreign investors are linked to the government s drive to
push Saudi citizens into jobs held by foreigners  via quotas and fees
for residency permits  Companies find it hard to obtain permits and
visas for foreign workers and their dependents  and hope authorities
will operate the system more smoothly and transparently  Last year s
crackdown on businessmen and officials raised serious questions
Details of the accusations and the  financial settlements  that
detainees paid before being released were never publicized   This
alarmed some Saudi businessmen  but Lovell said the crackdown may
ultimately have reassured foreign investors  as it has made all
parties in business deals more scrupulous about avoiding any
appearance of conflict of interest",2018-09-27,Reuters
68,Medtech firms get personal with digital twins,"By Caroline Copley HEIDELBERG  Germany  Reuters    Armed with a mouse
and computer screen instead of a scalpel and operating theater
cardiologist Benjamin Meder carefully places the electrodes of a
pacemaker in a beating  digital heart  Using this  digital twin  that
mimics the electrical and physical properties of the cells in patient
7497 s heart  Meder runs simulations to see if the pacemaker can keep
the congestive heart failure sufferer alive   before he has inserted a
knife  The digital heart twin developed by Siemens Healthineers is one
example of how medical device makers are using artificial intelligence
AI  to help doctors make more precise diagnoses as medicine enters an
increasingly personalized age  The challenge for Siemens Healthineers
and rivals such as Philips and GE Healthcare is to keep an edge over
tech giants from Alphabet s Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  to  Alibaba   NYSE
BABA  that hope to use big data to grab a slice of healthcare spending
With healthcare budgets under increasing pressure  AI tools such as
the digital heart twin could save tens of thousands of dollars by
predicting outcomes and avoiding unnecessary surgery  A shortage of
doctors in countries such as China is also spurring demand for new AI
tools to analyze medical images and the race is on to commercialize
products that could shake up healthcare systems around the world
While AI has been used in medical technology for decades  the
availability of vast amounts data  lower computing costs and more
sophisticated algorithms mean revenues from AI tools are expected to
soar to  6 7 billion by 2021 from  811 million in 2015  according to a
study by research firm Frost   Sullivan   The size of the global
medical imaging analytics software market is also expected to jump to
4 3 billion by 2025 from  2 4 billion in 2016  said data portal
Statista    What started as an evolution is accelerating towards more
of a revolution   said Thomas Rudolph who leads McKinsey   Company s
pharma and medical technology practice in Germany   GPS OF HEALTHCARE
For Siemens Healthineers and its traditional rivals  making the
transition from being mainly hardware companies to medical software
pioneers is seen as crucial in a field becoming increasingly crowded
with new entrants  Google has developed a raft of AI tools  including
algorithms that can analyze medical images to diagnose eye disease  or
sift through digital records to predict the likelihood of death
Alibaba  meanwhile  hopes to use its cloud and data systems to tackle
a shortage of medical specialists in China  It is working on AI
assisted diagnosis tools to help analyze images such as CT scans and
MRIs Siemens Healthineers  which was spun off from German parent
Siemens in March  has outpaced the market in recent quarters with
sales of medical imaging equipment thanks to a slew of new products
But analysts say the German firm  Dutch company Philips and GE
Healthcare  a subsidiary of  General Electric   NYSE GE   will all
come under pressure to prove they can save healthcare systems money as
spending becomes more linked to patient outcomes and as hospitals rely
on bulk purchasing to push for discounts  Siemens Healthineers has a
long history in the industry  It made the first industrially
manufactured X ray machines in 1896 and is now the world s biggest
maker of medical imaging equipment  Now  Chief Executive Bernd Montag
s ambition is to transform it into the  GPS of healthcare    a company
that harnesses its data to sell intelligent services  as well as
letting smaller tech firms develop Apps feeding off its database  As
it adapts  Siemens Healthineers has invested heavily in IT  It employs
some 2 900 software engineers and has over 600 patents and patent
applications in machine learning  It is not alone  Philips says about
60 percent of its research and development  R D  staff and spending is
focused on software and data science  The company said it employs
thousands of software engineers  without being specific  MEDICAL
REVOLUTION Experts say the success of AI in medical technology will
hinge on access to reliable data  not only to create models for
diagnosis but also to predict how effective treatments will be for a
specific patient in the days and years to come   Imagine that in the
future  we have a patient with all their organ functions  all their
cellular functions  and we are able to simulate this complexity   said
Meder  a cardiologist at Heidelberg University Hospital  in Germany
who is testing Siemens Healthineers  digital heart software    We
would be able to predict weeks or months in advance which patients
will get ill  how a particular patient will react to a certain therapy
which patients will benefit the most  That could revolutionize
medicine   To this end  Siemens Healthineers has built up a vast
database of more than 250 million annotated images  reports and
operational data on which to train its new algorithms  In the example
of the digital twin  the AI system was trained to weave together data
about the electrical and physical properties and the structure of a
heart into a 3D image  One of the main challenges was hiding the
complexity and creating an interface that is easy to use  said Tommaso
Mansi  a senior R D director at Siemens Healthineers who developed the
software  To test the technology  Meder s team created 100 digital
heart twins of patients being treated for heart failure in a six year
trial  The computer makes predictions based on the digital twin and
they are then compared with actual outcomes  His team hopes to finish
evaluating the predictions by the end of 2018  If the results are
promising  the system will be tested in a larger  multi center trial
as the next step to getting the software approved by regulators for
commercial use  Siemens Healthineers declined to say when the
technology might eventually be used by clinics or give details on how
its digital heart  or models of other organs it is developing such as
the lungs and liver  could be monetized   IN DATA WE TRUST Both GE and
Philips are also working on versions of digital heart twins while non
traditional players have been active too  Drawing on its experience of
making digital twins to test bridges and machinery  French software
firm Dassault Systemes launched the first commercial  Living Heart
model in May 2015  though it is only currently available for research
Philips sells AI enabled heart models that can  for example  turn 2D
ultrasound images into data that helps doctors diagnose problems  or
automatically analyze scans to help surgeons plan operations  Its
vision  like Siemens Healthineers  is to add more complexity to its
existing heart models by pulling together scans  ECGs and medical
records to create a model that can predict how a heart will respond to
therapy in real life  For now  such software is still in the early
stages of development and companies will have to work with regulators
to thrash out how predictive models can be approved before doctors are
willing to trust a diagnosis generated by a machine  Access to high
quality data with enough variation will be crucial  as will be the
ability to interpret that data and turn it into something medical
professionals can use  say experts  In particular  models will have to
be trained on rare cases as they get closer to perfection  said Vivek
Bhatt  chief technology officer at GE Healthcare s clinical care
solutions division   It s going to be extremely critical to have an
ongoing process for getting more data  getting the right kind of data
and getting data with those unique cases   he said  The established
medtech players say their long running relationships with hospitals
and research institutes and vast networks of installed machines will
give them an edge over new tech entrants  Siemens Healthineers  GE
Healthcare and Philips say their databases are fed with a mixture of
publicly available data  data from clinical trials or from
collaborations with hospitals   as well as some data from customers
All the data is made anonymous and only used with patients  consent
they say  Still  some campaigners and academics worry about patients
data being used primarily by companies as a commercial tool  Boris
Bogdan  managing director at Accenture s  life science practice in
Switzerland  believes the ownership of data is a gray zone that could
lead to a patient backlash if companies start making fortunes from it
When Facebook  NASDAQ FB  started nobody really cared who owned the

69,Japan s Nidec sees electric vehicles driving profits as it plans for future,"By Makiko Yamazaki KYOTO  Japan  Reuters    Since starting Nidec in
1973 in a tiny Kyoto shed with just three workers  Shigenobu Nagamori
has built it into the world s top maker of precision motors and became
one of Japan s most venerated business leaders  Nagamori guided Nidec
past Nissan and Panasonic in market value and helped place its
products in everything from cars to smartphones  But the 74 year old
now faces what may be his hardest task  passing the reins  Analysts
say it will be particularly tough at Nidec  where employees and
investors are enthralled by Nagamori s vision  outsized personality
and brash confidence   I ve made no mistakes in some 60 acquisitions
not a single one  whereas four out of five M A deals by Japanese
companies fail   Nagamori told Reuters in an interview   In February
he took a first step toward succession by announcing that Hiroyuki
Yoshimoto  50  credited for boosting margins at Nidec s automotive
parts unit  would take over as president  But Nagamori remained chief
executive and chairman and said he doesn t plan to resign yet
Although Yoshimoto is highly regarded   he worked at  General Electric
Co  N GE   auto parts maker Calsonic Kansei Corp and Nissan before
joining Nidec in 2015   some investors worry he can t sustain the
company s growth momentum   It won t be possible for anyone to fill
Nagamori san s giant shoes entirely   said Koichiro Hagiwara  an
analyst at the research arm of Tokai Tokyo Securities   At Nidec s
annual shareholders  meeting in June  one investor took to the
microphone to voice his concern   I come to the annual meeting because
I m really worried how much longer you can stay in management  I come
to check on your complexion  that you re not looking gaunt   he said
to Nagamori  who advised him to sit closer  earning laughs  REVERED
LEADER Analysts say Nagamori has an uncanny ability to predict
industry trends such as the rise of factory automation and shift to
electric vehicles   That has led to a string of successful
acquisitions to swallow up competitors and capitalize on industry
trends years in advance   Such acquisitions included units of
conglomerates Hitachi Ltd  T 6501  and Toshiba Corp  T 6502   as well
as rivals who couldn t compete on price  Nagamori  who still
personally approves every deal  said spotting good companies to buy
was a difficult skill to teach   The most important thing cannot be
put in writing or taught at Harvard Business School  intuition
Intuition can be passed on to someone to a certain degree  but not all
Nagamori said in an interview  sporting eyeglasses with green frames
his lucky color   Nidec s over 100 000 employees are known for their
loyalty  complying with Nagamori s often whimsical edicts   One year
he decided to hire new graduates based on eating competitions  Another
year he judged them on how loudly they could read a prepared text  But
there was a reason behind it all  he said  in Nidec s early days  many
applicants were from  third rate universities with bad grades   making
other qualities like willpower and stamina crucial  He has moved on to
more standard practices  he said  as the company attracts more
talented students   Outside the company  he is often compared to other
successful entrepreneurs such as SoftBank Group s  T 9984  Masayoshi
Son and Fast Retailing  T 9983  leader Tadashi Yanai  Both Nagamori
and Yanai served on SoftBank s board  although Nagamori stepped down
last year   BIGGER THAN TOYOTA Nagamori said he wants Nidec to
continue expanding  perhaps taking on Toyota Motor Corp  T 7203   the
biggest company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange  He said an accelerating
shift toward electric vehicles should help Nidec as automakers
outsource component production  Nidec  already the top player in
electric power steering motors  last year expanded into traction
motors  the most important element of an electric vehicle s powertrain
It has also formed a joint venture with Peugeot carmaker PSA Group to
produce traction motors  The company expects such motors to account
for the bulk of the estimated 6 trillion yen   54 billion  automotive
motors market in 2030    One day  all vehicles will be equipped with
Nidec motors  Nobody believes it now  but it will happen   Nagamori
said  Analysts said Nidec will face tough competition from
megasuppliers such as Bosch  which have strong relationships with
global automakers  But Takumi Sado  analyst at Daiwa Securities  said
he liked Nidec s chances anyway    Nidec was a late comer to the
market for electric power steering motors  but has already outgrown
traditional players such as Denso  T 6902   Nidec is planning to sell
its traction motors at very competitive prices  Few can compete with
Nidec on costs   Nagamori predicts robots will be used everywhere
including autonomous factories  and that each robot will be equipped
with multiple Nidec motors   He sees the company s sales growing to 10
trillion yen by 2030  almost seven fold from 1 49 trillion yen last
year    The best thing founders can do is to live as long as they can
and make companies as big as possible before the retirement   he said",2018-09-06,Reuters
70,Siemens lifts profit goals under new Vision 2020  strategy,"By John Revill MUNICH  Reuters     Siemens   DE SIEGn  unveiled its
new Vision 2020  strategy on Wednesday   a move designed to boost the
German engineering group s profitability in an era where sprawling
conglomerates are increasingly unloved by investors  The overhaul
which sees its five industrial divisions combined into three operating
companies   is designed to simplify the trains to turbine company and
make its structure leaner  Under the changes  Siemens  which is due to
report its latest earnings on Thursday  said it expects to increase
the annual growth rate and profit margin of its industrial business by
two percent over the medium term   defined as the next three to five
years  It also aims to increase its basic earnings per share at a
faster rate  Siemens said it would ramp up its investment in the
internet of things  electric mobility and digitalization  An early
sign of this came on Wednesday when it also announced it was buying U
S industrial software company mendix for 600 million euros   700
million   The changes come as large conglomerates have become
increasingly unfashionable with investors who favor pure play
companies which have had better share price and sales growth over the
last five years  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  noted in a recent report
Siemens  rivals like ABB  S ABBN  have come under pressure from
activist investors to spin off weaker performing units  while  General
Electric   N GE  is reported to be seeking a buyer for its digital
assets  Siemens s share price has gained 2 9 percent in the year to
August 1  one third of the gain made by the Stoxx 600 Industrial Goods
Services Index  SXNP   Under the changes  Siemens will reorganize into
three operating companies    Gas and Power    Smart Infrastructure
and  Digital Industries    to give its individual businesses  more
entrepreneurial freedom   the company said  The new units would work
alongside Siemens  so called  Strategic Companies    Siemens
Healthineers  Siemens Gamesa and the planned Siemens  Alstom   PA ALSO
train unit  where it has already reduced its ownership  DIGITAL
REVOLUTION Under the new strategy  which replaces Siemens  Vision 2020
plan unveiled in 2014  the Munich based company is targeting a higher
profit from the current range of 11 to 12 percent   It would be
irresponsible to rest on our laurels now  The speed and power of
global changes are increasing  and it s our obligation to anticipate
them  We re convinced that this is the right time to sustainably shape
our future   Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said in a statement   The
changes are designed to meet the digital revolution transforming
industry and is Kaeser s last chance to significantly change the
company before he steps down in 2021   The plan will go into effect
from the start of Siemens  new financial year on Oct  1 and aims to be
completed by the end of March 2019   Siemens said its corporate
headquarters functions would be leaner as a result of tasks being
outsourced  but gave no details of job losses  Workers at Siemens
warned that staff must not bear the brunt of the revamp and should be
offered reliable future employment prospects  Siemens labor boss
Birgit Steinborn said in remarks emailed to Reuters   Juergen Kerner
a member of IG Metall union s executive board and Siemens  controlling
panel  said workers will continue to resist any moves by Siemens to
adopt a holding structure    For the workers at Siemens  it s
important that the realignment will occur under the roof of Siemens AG
Kerner said   The filleting of companies with a broad portfolio is
currently a popular game of the so called financial markets but a
company like Siemens can act by its own strength",2018-08-01,Reuters
71,Most passengers in non fatal Mexican plane crash were U S  citizens,"By Efrain Vazquez DURANGO  Mexico  Reuters    At least 65 U S
citizens were aboard the Aeromexico passenger jet that crashed in
northern Mexico  a U S  official said on Wednesday  as investigators
combed the wreckage for clues to the cause of the accident  The Mexico
City bound Embraer 190 passenger jet smashed into scrubland near the
runway shortly after the plane took off from an airport in northern
Durango state on Tuesday  All 103 passengers and crew survived by
evacuating the plane before it caught fire   The U S  consulate
general in Monterrey and the U S  embassy in Mexico City have been in
touch with local and federal officials in Mexico and with the airline
an embassy spokesman said  Nearly everyone on the flight suffered
minor injuries  Mexican officials said  Luis Gerardo Fonseca  director
of Mexico s civil aviation agency  told local news media on Wednesday
that the plane s flight recorders had been found   Commercial aircraft
carry a cockpit voice recorder and a flight data recorder  commonly
known as  black boxes   which can contain crucial details of the last
minutes of a flight before an accident   Video purportedly of the
crash recorded from a plane window showed a dark sky and fog and the
ground still visible moments before a thud and shrieking passengers
were heard  Reuters could not independently verify the video   The
impact was very strong  We wanted to think it was a lightening strike
said Chicago resident and passenger Lorenzo Nunez   It was terrible
absolutely terrible   Nunez said he had been visiting family in
Durango  A time lapse video posted by Webcams of Mexico  filmed during
the hour before the crash  showed dark clouds and fog or rain moving
in  Officials said it was too early to say what caused the crash of
flight number 2431  Aeromexico said in a Wednesday morning Twitter
post that 64 people had been released from hospitals   Two people were
more seriously injured  including the pilot and a minor  the state
health department said  Fonseca told broadcaster ADN40 that his team
began working at the crash site around 7 a m  local time  1200 GMT
along with representatives of the U S  National Transportation Safety
Board  NTSB  and U S  Federal Aviation Administration  FAA
Representatives of Embraer SA and the maker of the plane s engines
General Electric   NYSE GE  Co  were also assisting  Fonseca said  It
can take safety investigators months to piece together the complex
chain of events leading to an accident  Determining the cause of the
Durango crash may be made easier by the location of the crash  which
should allow easy access to evidence  such as the retrieved flight
recorders  as well as interviews with the crew and other survivors
Under international rules  Mexico will lead the investigation with
support from Brazil  where the Embraer jet was designed and built  and
from the United States  where General Electric Co made the CF34 10E
engines    Aeromexico leased the 10 year old aircraft involved in
Tuesday s incident from Republic Airlines in the United States in 2014
according to data on Planespotters net  A spokesman for Republic
Airlines said on Wednesday that the company briefly leased the plane
to Aeromexico  but the aircraft was sold to a third party in 2015  The

72,Airbus Profit Jumps as Jet Delivery Delays Begin to Ease," Bloomberg     Airbus SE s  PA AIR  second quarter profit doubled as
the company accelerated deliveries of its best selling single aisle
jetliner following delays at the model s two engine providers
Adjusted earnings before interest and tax increased to 1 15 billion
euros   1 35 billion  from a restated 572 million euros a year earlier
Toulouse  France based Airbus said in a statement Thursday  Analysts
had estimated a figure of 1 05 billion euros  based on six estimates
compiled by Bloomberg  Customer payments for the re engined A320neo
family of planes had been held up by a three month halt in handovers
of Pratt   Whitney powered jets  which have been dogged by a series of
glitches  and manufacturing issues concerning aircraft with turbines
from  General Electric   NYSE GE  Co  led CFM  Airbus has since made
headway in reducing the number of planes parked outside its plants
from a May peak  with 110 Neos delivered in the first half out of 239
in total  Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders  who plans to stand down
next year  said that while Neo deliveries surpassed those for the
original A320 model in the second quarter  meeting a target of 800
handovers across Airbus s full aircraft lineup for 2018 as a whole
remains challenging  Cost Split  Our operational focus in commercial
aircraft remains squarely on securing the production ramp up   he said
Airbus is also assessing how to split additional costs from parked
narrow bodies with both engine suppliers  The A350 wide body program
has shown strong progress  according to the CEO  with the  cost curve
improving as output is increased to 10 planes a month by the year s
end  Combined with higher asking prices as the jet exits its launch
phase  when more bargains are on offer  that helped account for the
bulk of earnings improvements in the first half  though Enders said it
s still too early to decide on further production ramp ups  Airbus
confirmed plans to lift adjusted Ebit by about 20 percent to 5 2
billion euros this year before the integration of the new A220 plane
acquired from Bombardier Inc  It also still expects free cash flow
before disposals and acquisitions of approximately 3 billion euros
Demand for Airbus s planes remains strong  the company said  with more
than 430 orders and commitments worth in excess of  62 billion booked
last week at the Farnborough air show in England  the year s biggest
industry expo  The company booked a 98 million euro provision against
price escalation on the delayed A400M military transport program
together with costs of 21 million euros from its H160 helicopter and
40 million euros in compliance and merger expenses  At the same time
it had a 157 million euro gain from the sale of assets in its defense

weekend on a possible combination of Airbus s military aircraft assets

73,GE beats on EPS but trims cash flow target  shares fall,"By Alwyn Scott  Reuters     General Electric   NYSE GE  Co reported a
smaller than expected drop in profit on Friday  but cut a key
financial target  raising questions about its full year outlook and
sending shares sharply lower  The 126 year old industrial conglomerate
whose power and financial services units are struggling  said it
expects to generate perhaps  1 billion less free cash flow than
expected this year  The forecast cast doubt on GE s full year adjusted
profit target of  1 00 to  1 07 a share  Though GE affirmed that
target on Friday  many analysts see it as unrealistic and have cut
their estimates to less than  1 00    We are getting questions as to
how the company can maintain EPS guidance while cutting free cash flow
guidance   JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note on
Friday  GE s conference call with analysts also cast doubt on the
outlook   They gave you all the conditions for why the forecast could
go down   said Deane Dray  analyst at RBC Capital Markets  For example
GE had previously said it expects to ship 50 to 55 large power
turbines this year   On the call  they said  We re targeting 50    GE
also said power equipment sales may take longer to close   The only
thing you re going to hear from that is there s downside risk   Dray
said   The stock was down 5 2 percent at  13 02 in midday trading
The stock decline was  all about cash and  GE s  acknowledgement of
risk to the second half   said Jeffrey Sprague  analyst at Vertical
Research Partners   GE cut the industrial free cash flow target to  6
billion from a range of  6 billion to  7 billion   Its adjusted
earnings  which exclude certain pension and restructuring costs  fell

rose to  30 1 billion from  29 1 billion  GE said weakness in power
and renewables energy offset gains in its aviation and healthcare
units   A decade and a half ago  GE was the world s most valuable
public company  But the Boston based conglomerate foundered in several
industrial markets and its move into financial services steered it
into the global financial storm in 2008   GE shares have halved in the
past year  Though investors are still interested in GE  many want to
see the power and capital units stabilize and even improve before
buying the stock  analysts have said   THEY DIDN T SCREW UP   GE
revealed no new bad news about ongoing accounting investigations  a
shareholder lawsuit and a federal inquiry into subprime mortgage
activity  and appeared to be operating better  some analysts said
They didn t screw up   said Nick Heymann  analyst at William Blair
This was a quarter driven entirely by aviation and healthcare    GE
beat earnings expectations in part because it cut overhead costs more
than expected and the losses at GE Capital were less than analysts
expected  said RBC s Dray   The results capped an unusually busy
quarter in which Chief Executive John Flannery announced a long
awaited plan to spin off its healthcare unit and sell its 62 5 percent
stake in oil services firm Baker Hughes   In May  GE announced an  11
1 billion deal to merge its locomotive unit with Wabtec Corp  In June
it announced a  3 25 billion sale of its distributed power unit to U S

74,Column  Beyond GE   U S  workers own too much company stock in retirement plans,"By Mark Miller CHICAGO  Reuters    The decision marked the end of an
era  last month  the keepers of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
removed  General Electric   NYSE GE  Co  one of the original stocks
included in the index when it was created in 1896  The once mighty GE
had become the sixth smallest member of the 30 component Dow by market
value and carried the index s lowest stock price  The move by S P Dow
Jones Indices reflected the decline of an American industrial icon
But the company s plunging stock highlights a problem that refuses to
go away  too much concentration of employer stock in workplace
retirement plans  More than one third of GE 401 k  plan assets were
held in the company s own shares in 2016  federal filings show  Just
15 years ago  GE was the world s most valuable public company  But it
has struggled in several of its key industrial markets and suffered
losses in the financial services business during the global financial
meltdown of 2008  GE stock has fallen nearly 80 percent from highs in
2000  serving up a reminder of the risk of holding your employer s
stock in a retirement account  Changes in federal law have encouraged
retirement plans to move away from company stock ownership  and a
spate of lawsuits also have helped convince many plan sponsors to
reduce or eliminate the practice  Data from Vanguard points to an
encouraging trend  In 2017  among all account holders in defined
contribution plans administered by the mutual fund giant  90 percent
had no investments in their employer s shares  either because it was
not offered  76 percent  or they chose not to invest in it  14 percent
Five percent had holdings ranging from 1 percent to 20 percent of
their plan assets  and 5 percent had concentrated employee stock
positions exceeding 20 percent  The industries still most likely to
offer company stock were agriculture mining and construction  13
percent offered   Vanguard data shows   THE ENRON EFFECT The GE story
belies a sharp improvement in diversification by many 401 k  plans
over the past decade  As recently as 2007  nearly 25 percent of
Vanguard administered plans had employer stock concentration levels
higher than 20 percent  The more recent improvement stems in part from
the spectacular 2001 collapse of Enron Corp  which blew away the life
savings of thousands of employees holding the company s stock  The
ensuing Pension Protection Act of 2006 required defined contribution
plan sponsors to allow participants to diversify holdings away from
employer shares  and to notify them of their rights in this area
Most experts say employee retirement portfolios should not hold more
than 10 or 15 percent of their employer s stock   Since Enron  many
employers have decided this isn t a good thing for employees   that s
the good news   said Robert Pozen  a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan
School of Management  who recently reviewed federal filings of large
retirement plans      Unfortunately  quite a few companies have
continued to not only allow this but essentially encourage it  because
they make matching contributions with their own stock as a way to
conserve cash   he said   GE employees are not required to take
matching contributions in company stock  a GE spokeswoman said   Pozen
has no problem with employee stock ownership outside a retirement plan
or stock options  But most employees should hold broadly diversified
retirement portfolios  he said  Morningstar research has found that
the stock of companies with high allocations of their own stock in a
401 k  plan tended to underperform their peers on a relative
performance and risk adjusted basis      Moreover  Vanguard research
shows that concentrated stock positions tend to displace investments
in diversified equity funds and other balanced funds  Overall equity
allocations also tend to be higher  Another problem is exposing
workers to the double risk of potentially losing not only their
savings but their jobs  And the GE story underscores the false sense
of comfort that can arise among employee investors   Companies like GE
have done very well over many decades  but there are very few that do
really well over 30 or 40 years    Pozen said  I asked GE if it has
policies or programs in place encouraging diversification  Mary Kate
Nevin  manager of financial and executive communications  pointed to
language in an employee benefits handbook warning against the risk of
having any more than 20 percent of retirement savings in any single
company stock  or industry  She also noted that the 401 k  program
held more than 250 education sessions with workers last year that also
included messages about the importance of diversification   Pozen
thinks more will be required  He argues U S  Congress should take
steps to reduce or eliminate this risk by limiting holdings of
employer stock to 10 percent of plan assets   the same legal limit
that defined benefit plans must follow in their investment portfolios
You could grandfather existing programs  and tell them that they can
no longer increase the percentage of their own stock in the plan   he
said   It wouldn t be a dramatic thing  and it would be very positive
for plan participants",2018-07-12,Reuters
75,Exclusive  General Electric s power unit faces threat in Saudi Arabia,"By Alwyn Scott and Stanley Carvalho NEW YORK and ABU DHABI  Reuters
One of  General Electric  Co s  N GE  largest and most valuable
customers  Saudi Arabia  is lining up competitors to bid against GE
for lucrative power plant work  according to five people familiar with
the situation  State controlled Saudi Electricity Co  SE 5110   SEC
has qualified at least two companies   Power Systems Mfg LLC and
Combustion Parts Inc   to provide service or parts for some of SEC s
more than 50 GE made F class turbines  and is in talks with two others
over investments to set up facilities to service the SEC plants over
many years  according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter
The qualifications for the first time puts SEC in position to break GE
s hold on that work by having others bid against GE on maintaining the
F Class fleet   among the largest owned by a single entity and among
the most lucrative service portfolios in the industry   when the
existing contracts come up  according to the sources and industry
databases   Saudi Arabia  the world s largest oil producer  has grown
increasingly cost conscious  and under its  Vision 2030  reform plan
it aims to reduce oil dependence  lower state budget deficits and
create jobs  The kingdom also wants to obtain the best possible prices
on large contracts with big companies  according to a source with
direct knowledge of SEC  The utility is in the process of getting
other companies involved in bidding for power plant services  rather
than relying on GE as the sole provider  because qualifying
competitors will lower prices  the source said  Saudi Electricity Co
previously created competition for an earlier generation of turbines
known as the E class  according to the sources  After bidding began
GE ended up with less work and prices for the work fell by about 40
percent  sources said  One side effect of Saudi Electricity Co
qualifying third party firms to repair its F Class is that it is large
enough to enable competitors to set up operations that they could use
to sell the parts and repair services to customers outside Saudi
Arabia  potentially threatening portions of GE s service business
globally  three sources said  For bidders  qualifying also provides
inroads to selling to other utilities and even other industries
because SEC is seen as technically sophisticated and other companies
would rely on its qualification  one of the sources said  SEC declined
to comment  as did Power Systems Manufacturing  a unit of Ansaldo
Energia SpA of Genoa  Italy  and San Diego based Combustion Parts Inc
In response to questions from Reuters  GE said   At present  GE s F
class units in SEC continue to be covered under long term service
agreements   GE Chief Executive John Flannery has said service revenue
is important to restoring growth to GE s power business  where profit
fell 45 percent last year  The division  which makes equipment for gas
coal and nuclear power plants  is coping with a steep drop in orders
for new plants  As a sign of its emphasis on increasing its own
service revenue  GE in May posted videos on YouTube saying it is
offering high tech upgrades to turbines made by rivals  Siemens  AG
DE SIEGn  and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems  T 7011   Saudi
Electricity Co has not yet offered any substantial F Class contracts
to new bidders  and it is unclear how soon it intends to seek bids
the sources said  One source with knowledge of GE s service history in
Saudi Arabia said some F Class turbines that SEC purchased more
recently may not be under long term agreements because the service
price was high  and those could be opened for bidding by SEC at any
time  In addition to PSM and CPI  two other service companies said
they are in talks to qualify to work on SEC s F Class plants
Chromalloy  based in Palm Beach Gardens  Florida  and Al Masaood John
Brown  in Dubai  Both said they already work on SEC s E Class turbines
Al Masaood John Brown shareholders have approved investment to enable
it to repair certain F Class components at its Dubai facility  It
plans to present this to SEC as a way of  kick starting  the formal
pre qualification process  General Manager Brian Waddell said in an
email  Chromalloy said it is considering a large investment to enable
it to work on SEC s F Class turbines for the long term    We re
definitely willing to make that commitment and are in discussions with
SEC on that   said spokesman Jeff Romaine     We re looking at doing
parts repairs or manufacturing of parts for the long term   he added
That s what SEC is asking us for",2018-07-19,Reuters

billion of Chinese products on which to possibly levy duties
Companies including  General Electric   NYSE GE  Co  and trade groups
such as the U S  Chamber of Commerce say tariffs are the wrong way to
address allegations of intellectual property theft by China and that
firms are making contingency plans should a trade war ensue  Some
businesses tried to persuade the Trump administration to back down by
saying they d be left with no choice but to consider reducing
production  firing workers and even shifting operations out of the U S
to account for the added costs from import tariffs   With tariffs
against China taking effect  American consumers are one step closer to
feeling the full effects of a trade war   Matthew Shay  president of
the National Retail Federation  said   Reining in China s abusive
trade policies is a goal shared by many countries  but a strategy
based on unilateral tariffs is the wrong approach and it has to stop
SEMI  which represents semiconductor companies and others in the
manufacturing supply chain for the electronics industry  estimates
that the initial round of tariffs will increase costs for its members
by between  20 million and  35 million  The second list of  16 billion
in goods    which is more heavily focused on technology products
could produce a hit of at least  500 million  said Jay Chittooran  a
public policy manager for the group  The American Chemistry Council
estimates that the second wave of promised tariffs will affect  2 2
billion in imports of chemicals and plastics from China and  5 4
billion in U S  exports to China from retaliatory duties  said Ed
Brzytwa  director of international trade  The Trump administration did
remove some products from an initial tariffs list after companies and
businesses groups objected  The goods included electric and cordless
snow blowers made by New Jersey based Snow Joe LLC  said Joseph Cohen
the company s chief executive officer  But the list of  16 billion in
goods targeted for tariffs include Snow Joe tillers  garden
cultivators and log splitters  and imposing duties only means higher
prices for consumers and added cost and uncertainty for businesses  he
said   Tough Thing   Tariffs are always a tough thing to look at
because unfortunately the consumer does get hurt  business like mine
get hurt unintentionally in the process   Cohen said by phone  U S
soybean farmers    including from states that backed Trump in the 2016
election    are being particularly hard hit by the retaliatory duties
China is the top export market for U S  soybeans  accounting for
almost  14 billion in sales and representing nearly a third of total U
S  soybean production in 2017  according to the American Soybean
Association  Farming Pain Farmers are already feeling the pain with
canceled orders and falling commodity prices  without any promised
relief  said Max Baucus  a former Democratic senator from Montana and
ambassador to China  He s co chairman of Farmers for Free Trade  a non
profit group   For farmers across the country  the trade war is now
getting real   Baucus said in a statement  General Electric  one the
largest U S  employers and exporters  tried unsuccessfully to have 34
product lines removed from the list of goods targeted for tariffs  The
company has said imposing tariffs on products such as aviation and
medical parts could hit American operations and jobs    including its
Wisconsin based facilities that employ 6 000 people   We remain
concerned that these tariffs could make it harder for U S
manufacturers to compete in the global economy  and will shrink rather
than expand U S  exports   the company said in a statement   We will
work with the administration to minimize potential impact to our
businesses   Still  there aren t high hopes the administration will
change its approach  Brzytwa of the American Chemistry Council said
There s a viewpoint that s shared across the government  and certainly
at the White House  that there s going to be pain that U S  industry
is going to have to suffer in order to change China s behavior
Brzytwa said by phone   We think that you can change China s behavior
without shooting yourself in the foot",2018-07-05,Bloomberg
77,Brazil prosecutors allege jailed GE executive helped company partake in medical cartel,"By Brad Brooks SAO PAULO  Reuters     General Electric  Co s  N GE
chief executive for Latin America took part in a medical equipment
price fixing scheme while at the conglomerate  making it a member of
an international health care cartel  according to allegations in a
document filed by federal prosecutors  The executive  Daurio
Speranzini Jr   was one of 20 people jailed last week in what
prosecutors say was an arrangement among multinational companies
Philips  AS PHG   Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ   and several others  They
say the scheme involved bribing government health officials  in return
for help in inflating prices for an array of medical gear such as
magnetic resonance imaging machines and prosthetics  While those
arrests and the general allegations were widely reported last week  a
close examination by Reuters of a 362 page court document filed with a
Rio de Janeiro judge to gain approval to carry out arrest and search
warrants shows that prosecutors also argue that GE was part of the
group of companies that allegedly funneled bribes through a
politically connected local medical supply firm   That firm  Oscar
Iskin  then passed varying percentages of the bribes to government
officials to fix prices for medical equipment and other products
prosecutors assert    The situation takes on an even greater gravity
given that even after the internal investigation  at Philips  that
resulted in Speranzini s departure from the company  he joined another
company in the health sector  GE  in which he continued carrying out
illicit practices relative to government contracts   the document
states   The documents cited  robust evidence  that Speranzini
participated in the crimes of corruption  fraudulent bidding  and
forming a criminal organization   adding   there is also evidence that
he attempted to cover up the crimes so that regulating bodies would
not find out    In response to questions from Reuters  GE spokeswoman
Jennifer Erickson said Monday that GE is  currently not aware of any
improper conduct involving GE Healthcare and are committed to
cooperating with authorities to the extent we are contacted   At the
time of Speranzini s arrest on July 4  GE in a statement said that the
allegations refer to a period in which the executive was leading a
different company  though did not specify which one  and added that GE
is not the target of the investigation   Alexandre Lopes  a lawyer for
Miguel Iskin  the CEO of the supply firm  denied the allegations of
price fixing and passing of bribes  and said the company had improved
the quality of care available to the general population  Reuters was
unable to locate a lawyer for Speranzini  There are no lawyers listed
in the government documents  and GE declined to comment on anything
related to the executive still listed on LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  as an
employee  Prosecutors declined to comment beyond what was in the
document  or elaborate on whether they had contacted GE and whether
they were delving into its conduct as a target  They said in their
filing in Rio de Janeiro that their investigation is ongoing and that
they think it will involve more companies  more arrests and the
uncovering of more fraud   It was unclear from the document whether
prosecutors believe GE had been participating in the cartel before
Speranzini s arrival at the company  but the document asserts that he
was central to GE s involvement once he was there   Federal
prosecutors said in the document that Speranzini took part in the
cartel first as the head of the Philips Healthcare operation in Latin
America from 2004 until the end of 2010  when an internal
whistleblower told Philips  compliance office about the fraud and he
was fired after an internal probe  His firing and the internal probe
at Philips have not been previously reported  Philips spokesman Steve
Klink told Reuters that they have been informed by the Brazilian
authorities that the latest arrests are part of an investigation into
the medical device industry in Brazil    Philips in Brazil  as well as
other companies in the country  are subjects of the investigation  We
believe that any allegation against Philips relates to a period that
was many years ago   he said  Two months after being dismissed by
Philips  Speranzini was hired by GE Healthcare and climbed the company
ladder  becoming a vice president in Milwaukee before being named as
GE s chief executive officer for Latin America in January  GE did not
comment on Speranzini s hiring   Cesar Romero   the former No  2
official at the Rio de Janeiro state health secretariat   states in
his plea bargain testimony that Speranzini won contracts from Brazil s
National Traumatology Institute while at Philips and GE to provide
medical equipment at inflated prices at least until the end of 2014
prosecutors said   The National Traumatology Institute said they could
not comment  referring questions to the federal Health Ministry  The
Health Ministry did not respond to requests for comment  According to
prosecutors  Romero also testified that GE was part of what he called
an  international bidding club   which included other multinational
health companies such as Philips  Lawyers for Romero did not
immediately return a call seeking comment  Informants in criminal
investigations in Brazil are barred by law from talking to the press
The investigation  code named  Operation Resonance   is the latest
outgrowth of Brazil s unprecedented four years of graft inquiries that
have sent scores of powerful politicians and businessmen to prison and
rocked the nation s elite  who enjoyed impunity in how they carried
out their business  The inquiry is tied to a long running corruption
scheme attributed to jailed former Rio state governor Sergio Cabral
that snatched  100 million from public coffers  prosecutors said",2018-07-11,Reuters
78,Puerto Rico s Bankrupt Utility Is Leaderless After Pay Scandal," Bloomberg     Most board members of Puerto Rico s power utility
resigned Thursday after a chorus of outrage over pay for its new chief
executive officer  who then pulled out of the job  The tumult leaves
the troubled agency leaderless at a critical time in its bankruptcy
and sale of its assets  In a letter to Governor Ricardo Rossello  five
members of the panel said they were dismayed by  petty political
interests   Earlier  Rossello joined politicians and residents in
decrying the  750 000 salary pledged to incoming chief executive
Rafael Diaz Granados  which they said was exorbitant in light of the
island s financial crisis and the possibility that public employees
may soon face reduced benefits   We no longer believe that we have the
support to perform the politically unpopular tasks necessary to drive
the change from within PREPA   the board members wrote in the
resignation letter  which was confirmed by a person with direct
knowledge of the matter   When the petty political interests of
politicians are put ahead of the needs of the people  the process of
transforming the Puerto Rican electricity sector is put at risk   Diaz
Granados  himself a board member  quit that position and won t take
the chief executive job  according to the person  who asked not to be
named because it wasn t yet official  Rich and Poor Executive pay has
turned into a sensitive topic for the U S  commonwealth  As the entire
island wades through bankruptcy proceedings  many regular Puerto
Ricans  including low level public employees  face the prospect of
seeing pension payouts  Christmas bonuses and even sick and vacation
days slashed  Also under scrutiny is the paycheck for the executive
director of the island s fiscal control board  which the U S  Congress
installed to right the island s fiscal accounts  Diaz Granados was
named CEO on Wednesday  just hours after the surprise resignation of
Walter Higgins  Higgins quit after the legislature had sought to
prevent him from receiving a bonus on top of his  450 000 salary  Diaz
Granados s higher base salary  which the utility said was in line with
industry standards  appeared intended to circumvent the legislature s
anti bonus measure  Daunting Task The Prepa crisis comes at a critical
time  It s navigating bankruptcy court and working with investment
bankers to sell generation assets  potentially putting the
transmission and distribution business under a private concessionaire
The new leadership also faces the daunting task of addressing decades
of ingrained corruption  inefficiency and poorly maintained
infrastructure  In a press release Wednesday  the utility said Diaz
Granados s pay was in line with industry standards  citing an American
Public Power Association formula based on utilities  revenue  Diaz
Granados defended his salary in local radio interviews Thursday  He
said he was  sacrificing  to take the job  and said his previous
position at  General Electric   NYSE GE  Co  paid more than  2 million
a year  Indeed  Constance Lau  the CEO of Hawaiian Electric Industries
a utility that had comparable annual revenue  made  893 533 in base
salary in 2017  CEO Patricia Kampling of Alliant Energy Corp   which
also posted similar sales  earned  980 000  But those utilities are
investor owned  and the similarities with Prepa s financial situation
essentially end there  By comparison  Gil Quiniones  CEO of the state
owned New York Power Authority  makes  235 000 in base annualized
salary  And before Higgins and Diaz Granados  top Prepa executive
Ricardo Ramos had a salary of just  142 000  Livid Residents Diaz
Granados  a multilingual Harvard University graduate who is originally
from Colombia  spent 15 years at GE  including as president and chief
executive officer of GE Spain and Portugal and GE Mexico  Higgins
arrived on the island from Nevada in March without much Spanish  but
brought 40 years of management experience  Coraly Ortiz  a 43 year old
bank employee in San Juan  said she was furious about Diaz Granados s
salary   It s completely disproportionate and ridiculous  above all
with the situation in Puerto Rico   she said   They re creating an
elite of overpaid government officials taking advantage of the crisis",2018-07-12,Bloomberg
79,The culture clash behind GE s quick exit from Baker Hughes stake,"By Liz Hampton HOUSTON  Reuters    When  General Electric   NYSE GE
Co bought oilfield services giant Baker Hughes last July  it created a
global industry colossus with  22 billion in annual revenue  GE
promised to digitalize oilfields worldwide  marrying its expertise in
big data  analytical software and subsea equipment with Baker Hughes
experience in drilling services  chemicals and tools  Less than a year
later  GE is bailing out of the deal  the firm announced Tuesday
planning to sell its 63 percent stake in the combined firm over time
as part of a larger move to simplify its business and reduce debt  The
retreat comes amid slipping market share  management missteps and
culture clashes that have unsettled employees and frustrated suppliers
and customers  according to data reviewed by Reuters and interviews
with more than 30 employees  former employees  recruiters  analysts
suppliers and customers  GE managers initially took 11 of the combined
firm s top 15 posts and ushered in a by the book culture more like its
aviation business than that of oil industry  where relationships are
more prized and handshake deals are still common  said people who have
had dealings with both  In a Tuesday note to employees seen by Reuters
Baker Hughes GE Chief Executive Lorenzo Simonelli complimented his
amazing team  and reassured them about the path ahead  but
acknowledged  the last year has not always been easy for you  or our
customers and partners    I recognize that this moment is bittersweet
for some  welcomed perhaps by others   he wrote  Baker Hughes GE lost
market share in 12 of 19 services and equipment sectors between 2016
and 2017  according to a Reuters analysis of data from prominent
oilfield services consultancy Spears   Associates  In one area where
Baker Hughes has been a pioneer  drill bits  its share fell to 17
percent from 20 percent between 2016 and 2017  In a statement to
Reuters  Baker Hughes GE attributed the market share losses to
challenging market dynamics  and said most of the losses occurred
before the merger closed in summer of last year  Since the merger
suppliers have chafed under strict cost cutting demands  and some
customers shifted to competitors after abrupt service fee increases
and contract changes  according to suppliers  customers and former
Baker Hughes executives  The choppy transition also has driven out
veteran Baker Hughes managers in key departments and rattled staff
Revenue for the combined company last year was  21 9 billion  well
below the  23 8 billion estimated in its 2017 merger proxy  Baker
Hughes GE oilfield services and equipment revenues declined by  700
million  Rivals Schlumberger and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  posted higher
revenues on a resurgence in the North American hydraulic fracturing
market  said Chirag Rathi  a consulting director at market researcher
Frost   Sullivan  Baker Hughes sold a majority of its hydraulic
fracturing business in 2016  Baker Hughes GE said its financial
performance reflects broader industry trends and called itself a
strong and differentiated company  that now has a  defined path  to
unwind the merger over the next two or three years  It said it would
stay focused on supporting workers  customers and boosting shareholder
value  Baker Hughes GE s shares were up 2 percent to  33 13 on Tuesday
but still down nearly 18 percent since the merger closed  The company
will now set about dividing itself before ever fully integrating the
two firms  While the combined culture remains a work in progress   the
old Baker Hughes structure has been torn apart   said Edward Muztafago
director of equity research at  Societe Generale   PA SOGN   It
remains unclear whether Baker Hughes will continue to benefit from GE
s financial clout and advanced manufacturing over the long term   Last
year  Baker Hughes landed a major deal with Twinza Oil to provide
oilfield services  equipment and financing for an offshore development
near Papua New Guinea  Analysts say access to credit and lending from
GE Capital  a unit GE is now planning to shrink  helped that deal come
together  For now  Baker Hughes will continue to have access to
vaunted GE technologies that were cited as key advantages in the
original merger  including the GE Store  a technology and
manufacturing exchange  and GE s Predix operating system  which links
and monitors equipment through the internet  the company said  But the
company said Tuesday it would also develop solutions independent of
the Predix system  ABRUPT PRICE HIKES  CONTRACT CHANGES Shortly after
the merger closed last year  Baker Hughes GE made an  overnight
decision to raise prices and internal sales targets  a former employee
told Reuters  The moves  along with squeezing costs from supplier
contracts  aimed to raise revenue and margins  While oilfield margins
have modestly improved  they still trail well behind those of top
rivals Schlumberger and Halliburton  said Bernstein analyst Colin
Davies  who noted the oil price recovery has driven margin gains
industrywide  One privately held U S  oil producer that uses Baker
Hughes GE s artificial lift products said the company raised its
service prices by 20 percent late last year with little notice  The
customer shifted some of its business to a rival  Novomet Inc  even
after Baker Hughes GE agreed through negotiations to trim the increase
They re not managing the account as personally as they need to   the
customer said  declining to be named because of ongoing business
between the two firms  Baker Hughes GE declined to comment on its
pricing except to say it makes regular adjustments to stay competitive
Suppliers also have faced post merger changes to contract terms and
procurement processes  One company told Reuters that Baker Hughes GE
pressed for a 3 5 percent discount on goods and a 120 day grace period
on payments  terms the company rejected  Normally  customers pay
within 30 to 60 days  the supplier said  One dispute escalated into a
breach of contract lawsuit  Manufacturer Markall Inc built a
successful business supplying components to Baker Hughes over four
decades  but the relationship quickly deteriorated after the merger
In the suit  filed in November  Markall alleges Baker Hughes GE had
not paid for more than  5 million in custom parts that it had agreed
to buy before the merger  Baker Hughes GE declined to comment on the
lawsuit  saying it deals with issues predating the acquisition  EXODUS
OF EXECUTIVES GE Chief Executive John Flannery  appointed shortly
after the merger  foreshadowed Tuesday s announcement last November
when he said the firm was considering its  exit options  just months
after acquiring its controlling stake  Then the company canceled a
planned switch of former Baker employees to GE s healthcare plan
several former Baker Hughes and GE Oil   Gas employees told Reuters  A
move to cut staff just ahead of end of year holidays also hurt morale
two former workers said  Another sign of strain  the departure of
veteran employees in key positions  according to more than a dozen
sources familiar with the resignations  More than 50 resumes from

buyout group Advent agreed to buy  General Electric  Co s  N GE
distributed power unit for  3 25 billion  the companies said on Monday
marking GE s exit from a growing segment of the power business  GE had
put the unit  which makes Jenbacher and Waukesha brand reciprocating
gas engines  up for sale as part of a three year plan to exit about
20 billion in industrial assets  GE hopes to book as much as  10
billion in such proceeds this year  The sale  expected to close in the
fourth quarter  highlights the growing demand for reciprocating
engines by utilities  which pair them with wind and solar generators
Because the engines start quickly  they can fill in when wind and sun
falter and then be shut off when not needed  conserving fuel  Large
power turbines cannot start as quickly and so must be kept spinning at
partial power even when wind or solar electricity supplies are ample
Distributed Power is a terrific asset   said Ranjan Sen  managing
partner at Advent International   The business has significant growth
potential on a global scale and talented employees all over the world
Advent plans to  invest substantially  in critical areas such as the

maker Cummins  N CMI  in the final stages of the auction  Engine
makers Kohler and Wartsila  HE WRT1V  and investor KKR  N KKR   had
dropped out earlier  people close to the matter said  The sale
announcement did not have much effect on GE s stock  but  checks the
box on another divestiture simplification action by  GE  CEO John
Flannery   said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray  GE s stock was
down 1 5 percent at  12 85 in mid day trading in New York  in line

amortization of just below  290 million  said a person close to the
matter  Last year it posted revenue of  1 3 billion   Faced with weak
profits and calls to be broken up  GE is aggressively cutting costs
selling units and strengthening its balance sheet under a new board
and managers  Selling the industrial gas engine business is expected
to help streamline GE s  35 billion a year power division  whose
profit plunged last year as sales of power plants and services fell
sharply   Jenbacher and Waukesha engines range from 100 kilowatts to
10 megawatts  One of GE s key customers is the German port city of

engines will supply heat and electricity to homes and buildings  with
power supplemented by nearby wind turbines  GE said  The last of the
Debaucher s was delivered in March and the old coal plant is due to
shut down next year  GE said    Finland s Wartsila  which makes

82,Voters in opioid plagued districts demand solutions from candidates,"By Ginger Gibson BINGHAMTON  N Y   Reuters    Voters in this
struggling Rust Belt region in upstate New York  backed Donald Trump
in the 2016 presidential election  hoping he could help turn back a
relentless tide of factory and business closures  But the starkest
symptom of decline there   an opioid epidemic that has claimed the
lives of hundreds in and around the city of Binghamton   rages on  and
voters are demanding that candidates for public office address the
loss of life   This year s hard fought contest for New York s 22nd
Congressional District  which includes Binghamton  has drawn national
attention as a possible race in which Democrats could flip a
Republican seat in their battle to retake the House of Representatives
The two leading candidates  Democrat Anthony Brindisi and Republican
incumbent Claudia Tenney  have both focused on the opioid crisis
during the campaign  revealing sharp differences in how the two
political parties view the issue  Those differences are reflected in
swing races across the country in places hit hard by opioid abuse
including in Florida  Ohio  Kentucky and Pennsylvania  While
candidates in both parties support a range of solutions  Democrats
generally tend to emphasize health care and treatment  while
Republicans advocate stricter enforcement and reducing the
availability of illicit drugs   In the New York race  Democrat
Brindisi says he would promote better access to treatment for addicts
He has accused his Republican opponent  Tenney  of making things worse
by voting to weaken the Affordable Care Act  known as Obamacare  which
provides government funding for the health coverage many addicts rely
on    This should be a nonpartisan issue  but I have to question the
reasoning behind voting for health care bills that will make it easier
for insurance carriers to discriminate against drug treatment programs
he told Reuters   Tenney has co sponsored bills   which she points out
are bipartisan   that would strengthen punishments for sellers of
Fentanyl and study whether the government funded Medicare program
encourages over prescribing of opioids    We ve expanded Medicaid
under the ACA for years and yet the problem is getting more acute
she said   There are a lot of ways that we are tackling this that are
real solutions instead of throwing a lot of money at it    POLITICS OF
ADDICTION Voters  too  often look at the issue through a partisan lens
John Adams  a 50 year old speech and language therapist in Binghamton
says opioids are  absolutely  a top issue for him  which has him
leaning toward Tenney  He says he does not buy Brindisi s argument for
more spending    Do you give the money to cancer patients or to
addicts   he asked rhetorically   It s like  when do you tell your
kids the Easter Bunny isn t real    Alexis Pleus thinks neither party
has done enough to solve the crisis  but says Democrats are right to
push for more funding and for health insurance reform   For her  the
issue is personal  Her son  a restaurant chef  cycled in and out of
jail and rehab before dying of an overdose in 2014  The last time he
tried to get clean  Pleus said  he called her in tears to say his
health insurance wouldn t pay for a full course of treatment  and he
would be turned out after 14 days    The system without a doubt failed
him  He wasn t refusing help  he was begging for help   Pleus said
Democratic strategists believe the opioid issue can help them win
votes  They point out that Republican candidate Rick Saccone  who lost
a special election for a Pennsylvania House seat in March  drew flack
during the campaign for dismissing the role of the federal government
in solving the crisis  The victor in that race  Democrat Conor Lamb
made opioid abuse a central theme of his campaign  calling for
investment in prevention and expanded access to treatment  Some
Republican campaign strategists say they see the issue as not strongly
benefiting either party   It s very unlikely that either side will
really accrue any significant advantage over the other   from the
opioid crisis  said Neil Newhouse  a Republican pollster working on
several mid term races   For Democrats  the problem is that this issue
exploded on their watch  with Obama as president  That would serve to
undercut any advantage they might try to leverage on the issue
TELL TALE SIGNS The opioid crisis in Binghamton has been propelled by
continuing economic decline  The area used to have an array of large
employers  including  IBM   NYSE IBM  and  General Electric   NYSE GE
but both companies  along with others  have relocated many of the jobs
that used to be in the area   On the streets of Binghamton  only steps
from a sign marking the location where the flight simulator was
invented  signs of the epidemic abound  Discarded syringes litter the
ground and users nod off after injecting heroin     Emergency medical
personnel in the area say they answer as many as a dozen opiate
related calls a day  In the county where Binghamton is located 66
people died from overdoses in 2017  according to the district attorney
One resident  71 year old retiree Marie Hein  said the opioid issue
may swing her vote this fall  She voted for Tenney and Trump in 2016
and believes the president is doing a good job overall  but she says

83,Exclusive  GE seeking to shed troubled insurance business   sources,"By David French  Reuters     General Electric  Co  N GE  is working
with investment bankers to find ways to shed its insurance business
which has caused it to book hefty charges while sparking shareholder
lawsuits and an investigation by U S  regulators  people familiar with
the matter said on Tuesday  The move comes after GE announced in
January it would take a  6 2 billion after tax charge and set aside a
further  15 billion in reserves to help cover liabilities in insurance
operations held by its GE Capital unit  mainly concerning long term
care  LTC  policies  Many providers of LTC insurance  including GE
underestimated the cost of servicing policies  meaning premiums have
been unable to cover the spiraling costs of healthcare and longer life
expectancy  While GE s insurance operations have stopped generating
new business  existing contracts managed to maturity in a process
known as run off have become a major financial burden for the U S
industrial conglomerate  GE is hoping investment firms which
specialize in acquiring run off insurance businesses could buy some of
the assets  the sources said  While GE is focused on shedding its
troubled LTC business  it is open to divesting other insurance assets
including structured settlements and other life and disability
products  the sources added  The sources  who asked not to be
identified because the matter is confidential  cautioned that no deal
is certain given the liabilities that GE faces in its insurance
business  A GE spokeswoman declined to comment  GE spun out much of
its insurance business in 2004 into Genworth Financial  N GNW   itself
currently attempting a sale to China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co for
2 7 billion  That deal has been held up by the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States  a U S  national security panel   GE
said in January a review of its remaining insurance portfolio showed
300 000 policies needed  15 billion more in reserves to cover
potential payouts  or about  50 000 per policy  on top of the charge
it took as part of its fourth quarter earnings  It subsequently
disclosed the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  had begun
probing how it handled its insurance obligations  Insurance
liabilities stood at  38 billion at the end of 2017  according to GE s
annual report  GE has also been sued by shareholders accusing it of
concealing mounting insurance liabilities and the SEC probe  arguing
this cost investors tens of billions of dollars  Struggling to
maintain profitability and facing calls to be broken up  GE has
proposed major cost cutting and selling or spinning off parts of its
business including power  aviation and healthcare as a way to bolster
its value  As part of its drive to shed assets  GE announced an  11 1
billion deal on Monday to merge its transportation business with U S
rail equipment manufacturer Wabtec Corp  N WAB   with GE and its
shareholders owning just over half of the combined business    This

84,General Electric s power unit fights for growth as wind  solar gain,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK  Reuters     Vistra Energy Corp   N VST  and
Dominion Energy Inc  N D    which serve about 5 5 million electricity
customers in more than a dozen U S  states   both say they are done
building combined cycle natural gas fired power plants   Instead  they
are building large solar plants  which offer plentiful and inexpensive
electricity  This bearish view of fossil fuel energy  reflective of a
growing acceptance by utilities of renewable power sources  poses a
hurdle to John Flannery s plan to turn around  General Electric  Co s
N GE   35 billion a year power unit   GE s chief executive spelled out
the difficulty on Wednesday  Power profits will be flat this year
after falling 53 percent in 2017  he said  and GE is planning that
demand for heavy duty natural gas power plants will be less than half
what it forecast just over a year ago  and will stay at that level
through 2020   New plant sales are  going to be tough   Flannery said
at an investor conference on Wednesday   This is not going to be a
quick fix  but there is  at the end of the day  long life assets here
with intrinsic economic value  We re going to make the most of what we
have there   In the long run  Flannery and Russell Stokes  the head of
GE Power  have said demand for electricity and natural gas power
generators will grow about 2 percent a year   in line with global
forecasts   as utilities make a gradual transition to renewable power
Following a strategy he laid out in November  Flannery is cutting 12
000 jobs and  2 5 billion in costs at the unit  On Wednesday  he said
GE has tripled some sales incentives in the power division and is
competing aggressively for new contracts to maintain plants and to get
the call when utilities need parts or repairs during an unexpected
outage  something of which GE had lost sight   But some analysts and
investors are skeptical about the long term prospects of a business
devoted to natural gas and coal power plants that are falling out of
favor with utilities   The competition from solar and wind  along with
abundant low priced gas produced by fracking  is curbing orders for
new plants and forcing the closure of old ones  Some utilities are
even filing for bankruptcy   That means companies are going to have
trouble selling new fossil fuel plants   said Mark Dyson  a principal
at the Rocky Mountain Institute  an organization that researches the
power industry   Over 126 years  GE has weathered ups and downs in
power market before  and has legions of sales and service people
around the world  Last year it booked 26 orders for its newest gas
turbines in Mexico  Bangladesh and elsewhere  It is investing in its
separate   10 billion a year renewables unit focused on wind and hydro
which saw revenue fall 6 percent last year  GE also sells battery
storage  software and smart grid technology to work with wind and
solar systems  GE power equipment orders   an indicator of future
sales   fell 41 percent in the first quarter  accelerating from a 17
percent drop last year  according to GE s earnings reports  GE s
performance reflects the broader trend of utilities shifting to
renewables from fossil fuels  Global sales of large natural gas power
plants have fallen by half since 2013  according to McCoy Power
Reports  Coal and gas fired plants accounted for just 38 percent of
new electricity capacity financed globally last year  down from 71
percent a decade ago  according to Thomson Reuters data  Solar and
wind now draw 53 percent of such investment  up from 22 percent  a
Reuters analysis shows   For a graphic  click  Rivals  Siemens  AG  DE
SIEGn  and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries  T 7011  are cautious about the
scope for growth   We see a structural change   Lisa Davis  the chief
executive officer of Siemens Corp  the U S  unit  said in an interview
There are fewer large units being sold globally than there were five
years ago  I don t see that changing dramatically going forward
Siemens is cutting 6 100 power and gas jobs to adjust  Many utilities
share the view that the shift is permanent because it is driven by
economics rather than government policy and climate change concerns
While conventional power plants will continue to be built  sales may
never reach the levels seen just two years ago  industry experts said
With electricity prices trending downward  utilities are increasingly
unwilling to risk capital on a new plant unless then can lock in a
long term price  executives said    Building new large  combined cycle
gas plants is challenging without the stability of a long term power
contract   said Timothy Menzie  chief executive officer of InterGen
an international power generation company   POWER PLAYER GE faces a
further challenge  long term erosion of the large base of plants it
services  After acquiring the  Alstom   PA ALSO  power business in
2015  GE has a base of customers that produces one third of the world
s electricity  Long term contracts to service those plants bring GE
billions of dollars in annual revenue   But as utilities close older
coal and gas fired plants  the revenue growth from services is under
pressure  Wind and solar can cost as little as  18 a megawatt hour
compared with  40 for a large gas plant  said Mikael Backman  North
America regional director at Wartsila  HE WRT1V  Energy Solutions
part of the Finnish company that makes quick start natural gas fired
generators  Across much of the United States  some utilities now buy
all the cheap renewable power they can on electricity markets and use
quick start gas engines to fill in when wind and sun falter   In
California  regulators have put on hold a project that planned to buy
one of GE s large natural gas turbines while Southern California
Edison  which planned to buy the power  studies using wind and solar
instead  The shift from fossil fuels stretches beyond states like
California  which is aggressively switching to renewable power  In oil
rich Texas  wind and solar now provide 21 percent of the state s
electricity  Utilities there are shutting down the equivalent of about
20 average sized coal plants this year  according a Reuters analysis
of data from power system operator ERCOT  Out of 183 power generation
projects on the drawing boards  only four would run on fossil fuels
ERCOT said  The rest are wind and solar   ExGen Texas Power  an
affiliate of  Exelon Corp   N EXC   filed for bankruptcy protection in
November for five natural gas plants  the second such bankruptcy in
Texas last year attributed to low power prices  GE supplied parts and
service to several of the plants  according to the bankruptcy filings
Reuters could not determine whether the contracts will remain in
effect  In Virginia  Dominion Energy ended several maintenance
contracts it had with GE this year when it mothballed a large gas
fired plant built by companies GE later acquired and idled seven other
coal and natural gas units in the state  Dominion aims to build 4 720
megawatts of solar by 2033  the equivalent of about five large
combined cycle power plants  It is opening a new combined cycle

threats to slap tariffs on Chinese imports  U S  retailers warned
President Donald Trump has threatened to impose duties on as much as
150 billion in Chinese goods to punish Beijing for alleged violations
of intellectual property  The administration hasn t said when tariffs
will take effect  and is holding high level negotiations with Chinese
officials that could result in a change of policy  The U S  Trade
Representative s office said it was careful to pick a list of imports
that wouldn t raise prices for consumers  But representatives for the
U S  retail industry noted Wednesday that the tariff list still
includes televisions  monitors  mini refrigerators  tools and other
products sold at stores run by Walmart  NYSE WMT  Inc  and  Target
Corp   NYSE TGT  They spoke during the second day of three day
hearings in Washington on the proposed tariffs   It s not complicated
David French  senior vice president for government relations at the
National Retail Federation  told a panel of government officials at
the hearing   Higher tariffs are a tax on growth that will hurt
consumers and cost American jobs   Additional Costs Retailers will
pass on to consumers the additional costs from tariffs because they
can t quickly change suppliers  French said  Stores have already
placed orders for back to school and holiday sales  he said   General
Electric   NYSE GE  Co   one the largest U S  employers and exporters
said imposing tariffs on products such as aviation and medical parts
could hit U S  operations and jobs    including its Wisconsin based
facilities that employ 6 000 people  The company asked the government
to exclude components that are intracompany transfers from facilities
in China that are owned and controlled by U S  manufacturers  as well
as inputs that cannot be quickly replaced and those containing high U

costs on U S  businesses  workers and consumers without advancing
and even potentially undermining    the president s goals   Karan

deputy U S  trade representative  said in his testimony  No Consensus
There s no clear consensus among economists about the long term price
impact of tariffs  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President
John Williams said May 15 that a  huge increase  in tariffs would hurt
economic growth and prove inflationary  But the International Monetary
Fund s Western Hemisphere Director Alejandro Werner in April said that
price increases from tariffs would be temporary  American retailers
aren t so sanguine  The National Retail Federation and Consumer
Technology Association released a study last month estimating that the
proposed tariffs and resulting decline in U S  imports from China
would force consumers to pay  711 million more during the next year
than they otherwise would for the televisions they continue to buy
The American Apparel   Footwear Association is opposing tariffs on
dozens of lines of textile  apparel and footwear equipment and
machinery such as sewing machines because it says the duties would
boost costs for members in the U S  The average family of four would
pay at least an additional  500 a year to buy consumer products

86,GE to merge transportation unit with Wabtec in  11 1 billion deal,"By Harry Brumpton and Rachit Vats  Reuters     General Electric  Co  N
GE  announced a  11 1 billion deal on Monday to merge its
transportation business with U S  rail equipment manufacturer Wabtec
Corp  N WAB   with GE and its shareholders owning just over half of
the combined business  The deal  first reported by Reuters on Sunday
is the biggest to be inked thus far by GE Chief Executive John
Flannery since he announced a major overhaul of the U S  industrial
conglomerate late last year  The transaction values the GE
transportation business  which makes train engines  at  11 1 billion
GE will receive a  2 9 billion up front payment in cash and a 9 9
percent stake in the combined company  with GE shareholders awarded 40
2 percent and existing Wabtec shareholders owning 49 9 percent  GE
shares rose 2 8 percent to  15 39  Wabtec shares rose 4 3 percent to
99 28   The deal is tax free for GE and Wabtec shareholders because it
is structured as a so called Reverse Morris Trust  with GE spinning
off the transportation unit and simultaneously merging it with Wabtec
The  11 1 billion deal value includes a  1 1 billion net tax benefit
accruing to the combined company  GE and Wabtec said   The equity
value of the company combining Wabtec and GE s transportation business
will be more than  20 billion  The deal caps a review of the
transportation division by GE dating back to last year after a string
of setbacks for the 126 year old company  But it also follows years of
on and off talks between Wabtec and the GE unit about combining
Wabtec Chief Executive Raymond Betler told Reuters in an interview
We ve always been quite interested  There has been a relationship
between  us  that goes back decades   he said   For a whole host of
reasons  the stars kind of lined up this time  and it presented an
opportunity for us to actually get it done   Betler will remain
president and CEO of the merged company while its chairman  Albert
Neupaver  has been re appointed executive chairman  GE Transportation
Chief Executive Rafael Santana will become president and CEO of Wabtec
s freight segment  The resulting company will have approximately  8
billion in revenues  with 27 000 employees across 50 countries  the
companies said  The transaction is expected to close in early 2019  GE
s transportation business  which generated revenue of  3 9 billion
last year  is already larger than its sole close peer in the railroad
engines business   Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT   selling equipment and
services to a global fleet of roughly 23 000 locomotives  Santana said
The deal will add more offerings that can improve efficiency and
safety to GE s customers  which include Komatsu Ltd  T 6301  and  Rio
Tinto  PLC  L RIO   as well as Wabtec s client base which includes
Siemens  AG  DE SIEGn  and  Bombardier Inc   TO BBDb   Santana added
Wabtec  which has a market capitalization of  9 2 billion
manufactures equipment for locomotives  freight cars  and passenger
transit vehicles  Flannery told GE shareholders late last year he
plans to pare GE down to three core businesses  power  aviation and
healthcare  a departure from the deal driven empire building of his
predecessors  Jeff Immelt and Jack Welch  That should include GE
getting rid of at least  20 billion of assets through sales  spin offs

geopolitical tension in the Middle East after President Donald Trump
withdrew the United states from the Iranian nuclear agreement  Prices
rallied sharply last week after Trump walked away from an
international nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed  the highest level
of economic sanctions  against the country  Some analysts have said
the reinstatement of sanctions could lead to tighter global oil
supplies as they make it more difficult for Iran to export oil  Iran
which is a major Middle East oil producer and member of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC   resumed its
role as a major oil exporter in January 2016 when international
sanctions against Tehran were lifted in return for curbs on Iran s
nuclear program  Exiting the deal leaves the U S  at odds with Europe
and other parties to the deal  who will try to keep it in place  It
may also increase tensions in the Middle East  especially between
Israel and Iran  New York traded WTI crude futures ended the week up
roughly 1 4   at  70 70 per barrel  for the fourth positive week in
five  The U S  benchmark touched an intraday high of  71 89 on

It climbed to a three and a half year high of  78 00 on Thursday
Aside from geopolitics  oil traders will also continue to weigh a
steady increase in U S  production levels in the week ahead as the
rise in U S  drilling marked one of the few factors tamping back crude
in an otherwise bullish environment  U S  drillers added 10 oil rigs
in the week to May 11  bringing the total count to 844  the highest
number since March 2015   General Electric   NYSE GE  s Baker Hughes
energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday
That was the sixth consecutive weekly increase in the rig count

around 11 million bpd  Fresh weekly data on U S  commercial crude
inventories on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand
in the world s largest oil consumer and how fast output levels will
continue to rise will capture the market s attention  Market players
will also focus on monthly reports from the Organization of Petroleum

platform in the U S  Gulf of Mexico  a dog sized robot called Maggie
uses magnetic tracks to creep along pipes connecting the giant oil
facility to the sea floor  Before MaggHD  dubbed  Maggie  by  BP   LON
BP   the dangerous inspection job was reserved for highly paid
specialist technicians who did their jobs while rappelling along the
platform  The energy industry has turned to robots and drones to cut
costs and improve safety in some of the world s tougher working
environments  Drones inspect gear high up on floating rigs  Robots
crawl underwater to test subsea equipment for microscopic metal cracks
Remotely operated mini submarines can replace divers  Big oil
producers such as BP and  Statoil   OL STL  are racing to create the
oilfields of the future  where smart devices replace workers  They
have the potential to cut costs  save lives  and reduce the scope for
human error   This is going to change the way oil and gas does
business   Carri Lockhart  senior vice president of offshore at
Statoil USA  said in an interview earlier this year  referring to the
push towards autonomous gear and facilities   MAGNETIC CRAWLERS
Maggie belongs to a group of devices known as magnetic crawlers  which
can move across rigs  platforms  and pipelines above and below water
using ultrasonic test devices and high definition cameras  They can
cost  60 000 apiece  BP  the largest operator in the U S  Gulf of
Mexico  piloted Maggie on its Thunder Horse platform last year and
expects to roll out similar crawlers across all its Gulf of Mexico
platforms in coming years   BP s 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion
in the Gulf of Mexico  which killed 11 people and was the largest
accidental release of oil into U S  marine waters  underscored the
dangers of offshore work   BP wants the robots  to remove individuals
from being in unsafe environments  The efficiencies we gain by
collecting data this way are significant  The safety factor is obvious
said Dave Truch  a technology director in BP s Digital Innovation
Organization  Drones and crawlers can do inspections in about half the
time of rope access technicians  while placing fewer workers in harm s
way  executives at BP said this week  Other gadgets can reduce the
need for shutdowns  which are sometimes necessary for safe inspection
of equipment by humans  Drones can conduct inspections of flaring
equipment  which burn off dangerous gases at oil and gas production
facilities  without requiring a shutdown  Those shutdowns could last
anywhere from five to 20 days  said Iain Gault  a business development
manager at Stork  an energy maintenance unit of  Fluor Corp   NYSE FLR
We still can t do the physical work with a drone or crawler  but the
efficiency is gained by only putting people in the field when needed
said Gault  who started his career in oil and gas as a rope access
technician  rappelling along the sides of oil structures in the North
Sea  nearly 30 years ago  The technology can be a  hard sell   because
of the high upfront cost  he added  estimating crawler rentals run
between  600 to  1 000 per day  excluding the cost of an operating
technician  Hiring technicians for drones is even more costly because
they require pilot s licenses  he added   Companies that provide the
inspection specialists for offshore equipment say they are not worried
about losing out to robots and gadgets   It is not a threat to jobs
but they change  We have to adapt   said Ryan King  a technical sales
representative for Oceaneering International  an offshore services and
equipment provider   We re at a point now where big data is helping
optimize inspection programs  so we don t have to send guys into the
field   King said  Drones and crawlers may be a stepping stone

93,U S   Europe order emergency checks on engine type in Southwest accident,"By David Shepardson and Tim Hepher WASHINGTON PARIS  Reuters    U S
and European airline regulators on Friday ordered emergency
inspections within 20 days of nearly 700 aircraft engines similar to
the one involved in a fatal Southwest Airlines  N LUV  engine blowout
earlier this week  citing risks of a similar mishap  The directives by
the U S  Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation
Safety Agency for inspections of CFM56 7B engines  made by CFM
International  indicated rising concerns since a similar failure in
2016 of the same type of engine  The engine explosion on Southwest
Airlines flight 1380 on Tuesday was caused by a fan blade that broke
off  the FAA said  The blast shattered a window  killing a passenger
in the first U S  passenger airline fatality since 2009   The unsafe
condition   the FAA said in the order   is likely to exist or develop
in other products of the same design   The inspections ordered are a
sharp step up from actions by both the European and U S  regulators
after a Southwest flight in August 2016 made a safe emergency landing
in Pensacola  Florida  after a fan blade separated from the same type
of engine and debris ripped a hole above the left wing  The European
agency had given airlines nine months to check engines  while U S
regulators still were considering what to do  Ultrasonic inspections
on fan blades that have been used in more than 30 000 cycles  or in
service for about 20 years  will be required in the next 20 days  the
agencies said on Friday  A cycle includes one take off and landing
That order will affect about 680 engines globally  including about 350
in the United States  the FAA said  The engine that blew apart on
Tuesday s Southwest flight would have been affected  since the company
said it had 40 000 cycles  The coordinated 20 day measure partially
resolves a gap in previous responses to the 2016 accident by the world
s two largest and most influential aviation regulators  a person
familiar with the discussions said and published documents show  The
FAA in August 2017 drafted an order giving airline up to 18 months to
carry out checks  but it had not finalized the measure by the time of
Tuesday s fatal second accident  The EASA had rejected a request by
one airline to double the time allowed for checks to 18 months
matching the FAA s roll out  saying data did not justify that  The
divergence marked a rare difference of approach between the two
agencies  especially on one of the world s most used aviation products
CFM  which is jointly owned by  General Electric  Co  N GE  and France
s  Safran   PA SAF   produces the CFM56 engine in factories based both
in the United States and in Europe   It happens that there are
disagreements about the right way to go in some cases  and this was
one of them   the person familiar with the discussions said  On
Tuesday  however  when news broke that a second failure had taken
place involving the same model engine  aircraft and airline   this
time killing a passenger who was partially pulled through a gaping
hole next to her seat   the two agencies agreed to act quickly  the
person said  An FAA spokesman said the agency disputed that it had not
agreed with European regulators on the response to the engine issue
An EASA spokesman declined to comment  On Wednesday  National
Transportation Safety Board  NTSB  Chairman Robert Sumwalt  the chief
investigator of U S  aviation accidents  said he could not yet say if
the incident pointed to a fleet wide issue  The NTSB declined to
comment on Friday  The FAA and NTSB have different roles
Investigators study the probable cause of single accidents and
recommend possible changes to safety rules  while regulators have to
assess whether safety risks could appear  Several major airline
officials said the order will primarily impact airlines with higher
utilization of aircraft covering shorter routes like Southwest
Southwest  which had opposed efforts by the engine maker last year to
shorten the FAA s earlier proposed deadline  on Friday said its
maintenance program meets or exceeds the new requirements  United
Continental Holdings  N UAL  said that it had begun inspections
earlier after a recommendation from CFM  American Airlines  O AAL
said it does not have any CFM56 7B engines with 30 000 cycles and
would not be impacted by the 20 day order  Delta Air Lines  N DAL
said it had begun complying and did not expect any operational impact
to customers Approximately 14 000 CFM56 7B engines are in operation
CFM had initially recommended the inspections  The European order
requires that after the first inspection  airlines should keep
repeating the process every 3 000 cycles  which typically represents
about two years in service  More than 150 have already been inspected
Inspections recommended by the end of August will affect an additional
2 500 engines",2018-04-20,Reuters

95,Inside Deripaska s scramble to soften Russia sanctions blow,"By Polina Devitt  Dmitry Zhdannikov and Julia Payne MOSCOW LONDON
Reuters    In December  as news reports emerged about potential new U
S  sanctions against Russia  aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska
instructed advisers to draw up contingency plans  according to people
close to the businessman and his firms  Senior executives  lawyers and
aides working for the Russian tycoon met almost weekly to develop a
game plan for different sanctions scenarios  the people said  They
even took preemptive steps to mitigate the impact of sanctions
including switching most dollar payments and loans of Deripaska s En
Group PLC into euros and pounds as well as planning to replace U S
equipment suppliers with European ones  according to one of the people
involved in the planning  But they concluded there was one scenario so
severe that there would be little they could do if it came to pass
the stiffest sanctions being applied to his business empire  not just
Deripaska himself   People inside the room had a cold sweat   when
that scenario was mentioned  the person said   You cannot prepare for
this   It was this scenario that Washington chose  On April 6  it
announced sanctions against Deripaska and his eight companies  along
with other Russian individuals and firms  in response to what the
United States called  malign activities  by Russia  By adding
Deripaska s businesses to its Specially Designated Nationals blacklist
the first time Washington had done so with a publicly listed Russian
company   the U S  effectively choked off their access to the
international financial system  The move sent reverberations around
the world  Deripaska s business empire   which includes United Company
Rusal PLC  the world s second largest aluminum producer by volume of
production   has a global footprint and counts major international
companies as customers  The extent of the impact shows the power the
United States exerts over the global financial system through the
dollar clearing process  Rusal  the largest part of Deripaska s empire
has seen customers stop buying its aluminum and creditors scramble to
offload debt  Hong Kong listed Rusal has lost more than 60 percent of
its share value  Deripaska s En  Group PLC  which owns part of Rusal
and supplies power and coal  has also seen its London listed shares
more than halve in value   Deripaska has called the sanctions  very
unfortunate but not unexpected   He added that his inclusion on the
list was  groundless  ridiculous and absurd    A spokeswoman for
Deripaska declined further comment  Rusal has said its inclusion on
the sanctions list could leave it unable to pay billions of dollars it
owes to its lenders   some of the leading Western and Asian banks  On
Monday  the United States opened the door to sanctions relief for
Rusal when the Treasury said in a statement it could soften the
measures if Deripaska ceded control in the firm  The Treasury said its
goal was to avoid hitting businesses around the world which depended
heavily on supplies from Rusal  The news sent shares in Rusal up more
than 13 percent in Moscow  but they remain far below pre sanctions
levels   ROAD BLOCK  The team assembled in December consisted of about
a dozen top managers   including executives from finance  legal and
human resources   and aides to discuss ways to mitigate the impact of
sanctions on Rusal  A similar team gathered to focus on En   according
to the people familiar with the planning  The groups met in their
separate Moscow offices and gave regular updates to Deripaska  in
person and by emails  the people said  The biggest concern was that
tough sanctions against Deripaska s businesses would stop Western
banks and clearing houses from interacting with them  impacting
everything from raising debt to sales on world markets  according to
the people  Deripaska took pre emptive steps  In February  the
billionaire announced his resignation from executive positions at En
and Rusal  The hope  according to one source close to Rusal  was that
he would protect the companies from sanctions even if he was put on
the list himself  Deripaska made other changes out of the public eye
In a previously unreported move  En  had by March switched most of its
dollar payments and loans into euros and pounds  according to a person
familiar with En  preparations  That means the company can service its
debts and receive payments which otherwise would have stopped if they
remained dollar denominated  Another key concern was the impact
sanctions would have on suppliers of equipment to Deripaska s firms
as tough sanctions against his entities would prohibit U S  companies
from doing business with them  The En  team of advisers put together a
plan aimed at cutting exposure to U S  turbines suppliers such as
General Electric   NYSE GE  and replacing them gradually with European
firms  the person familiar with En  preparations said   But on a
number of other issues we hit a road block   the person said  He cited
a failed pre sanctions attempt to find a non U S  bank to act as a
depositary for En  s London listed shares  known as Global Depository
Receipts or GDRs  a role then held by  Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C    We
tried EU banks  Hong Kong banks  even an Israeli bank   but as soon as
we mentioned possible sanctions  it wasn t going anywhere   the person
familiar with En  preparations said  without naming the banks   All
transactions are done through the dollar and no one wanted to take the
risk of being cut off from dollar clearing   The person added the En
group also looked into moving trading of its GDRs to Moscow from
London but concluded a new initial public offering would be needed to
achieve that   We simply didn t have that time   the person said  When
the sanctions were announced in April  Citigroup  the custodian for
GDRs at En   suspended all transactions  The move rattled investors
because the sanctions require that U S  citizens must divest of any
stocks  bonds or other holdings in the targeted firms by May 7
Several days later  Citigroup informed En  that it had begun
facilitating transactions again with its GDRs  according to a
statement from En   Citigroup declined to comment  But  according to
the person familiar with En  preparations  holders of En  GDRs have
not been able to sell because the designated clearing house Euroclear
is not settling the trades  the stage at which cash and securities
trade hands  Belgium based Euroclear declined to comment  FEWER
OPTIONS The Rusal contingency team felt like it had fewer options than
their En  counterparts because the metals producer had a much larger
portion of debt and contracts in dollars due to the nature of the
aluminum market  according to three people close to Rusal  One of
these people also said the aluminum company didn t prepare well for
the toughest sanctions  because Deripaska and the contingency team
believed the United States would not want to disrupt the aluminum
markets and because the U S  had not levied sanctions against a
publicly traded Russian firm before  Rusal had no plan in place for
requesting immediate help from the Russian government to assist in
refinancing debt or paying its employees  according to the three
sources close to Rusal  Russia s industry and trade minister told
reporters last week that the government had not received a detailed
request for help from any of Deripaska s companies  The people close
to Rusal also said such requests have not been filed  although two of
them added that the company was working on such a request  A Kremlin
spokesman said on Thursday that a temporary nationalization of Rusal
was among options the Kremlin was studying to help the company
navigate sanctions   Russia s prime minister has described the
sanctions as an attempt by the United States to capture new markets
for its companies and directed the Russian government to study
measures to support firms under fresh sanctions",2018-04-23,Reuters

99,Exclusive  Russia s drive to replace Western power technology hits snag,"By Anastasia Lyrchikova MOSCOW  Reuters    Russia s drive to build a
large power generating turbine to lessen its dependence on Western
technology has suffered a major set back after a prototype broke
beyond repair  two sources familiar with the project told Reuters  In
the past few years Russia has imported the large capacity gas turbines
required to run modern power stations from firms such as  Siemens   DE
SIEGn   GE  N GE  and  Alstom   PA ALSO   After Western sanctions were
imposed on Russia over the conflict with Ukraine four years ago
Russian President Vladimir Putin urged officials to replace imported
technology with home grown substitutes in energy  software  aerospace
and medicine  The mishap with the 110 Megawatt turbine  a capacity
large enough to power a sizeable town  underlines the technical
challenges  Testing was underway on a prototype 110 MW turbine at the
Saturn engineering plant in Rybinsk  central Russia  in December last
year according to one of the two sources  who are both in the energy
sector and familiar with the results of the tests   The turbine fell
apart   said the first source  who spoke on condition of anonymity
because of the sensitivity of the subject   They tried to repair it in
time for March  but they did not manage it   March was the target date
for completion of tests on the turbine  Putin  in power since 1999
won a second consecutive term in an election on March 18  The first
source  and a second source  both said it was not possible to rebuild
the prototype turbine and the project would have to start again with
new equipment   The turbine broke up   said the second source  who
requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media
There s no turbine  that s it    NOT FATAL  Without any home grown
equivalents  Russia should in most cases still be able to buy turbines
from Western suppliers  but U S  and European Union sanctions have
made it harder to import Western power technology under certain
circumstances  Last year Russia clandestinely delivered turbines made
by Siemens to a power station in Crimea  which is subject to sanctions
and the European Union retaliated by imposing extra sanctions on
officials and companies involved in the operation  Set backs to the
domestic turbine program could hamper the modernization of power
generation if growing tensions with Western states result in tighter
sanctions since Russia s modernization plan is focused on using gas
turbines  The technical hitch also carries a potential political cost
Putin has publicly trumpeted progress in replacing Western technology
imports  so any failures will jar with the picture of success he has
painted  The new turbine is being developed by a consortium of ODK  a
unit of state owned conglomerate Rostec that owns the Saturn factory
where the testing was being conducted  Russian state technology firm
RUSNANO  and state energy firm InterRAO  In a statement  ODK said one
of the mechanisms of the prototype turbine had malfunctioned  It said
that would delay work on the project  but could be fixed   It is not
fatal for the project   It said set backs were to be expected since
this was a pioneering project for Russia  RUSNANO acknowledged there
had been an accident but gave no details  It said it remained
committed to the turbine project and expects it will be completed
InterRAO declined to comment  Russia s Trade and Industry Ministry
which oversees the machine building sector  declined to comment and
referred questions to Rostec  WESTERN SANCTIONS Large capacity gas
turbines have been in use around the world for years but their
construction is tricky to perfect  Because they operate at extremely
high speeds and high temperatures  they need to be engineered to very
precise standards and they use sophisticated electronic control
systems to make sure that they operate efficiently  For many years
Russia made no major investment in developing the technology because
it was able to import the turbines or the know how to produce them  A
scheme started in the 1990s to develop a large capacity turbine
produced prototypes but they did not go into production  At a meeting
in Russia s second city of Saint Petersburg in May last year  chaired
by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev  Energy Minister Alexander Novak
said a 110 MW turbine had been developed and testing should be
completed by March 2018    This is the first Russian produced powerful
machine with 100 percent domestic manufacture and it will  of course
help us to completely substitute purchases of foreign equipment of
this capacity   Novak told the meeting  His ministry did not respond
to questions on Tuesday about the set back",2018-04-17,Reuters
100,GE books  4 2 billion charge  restates earnings as expected,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK  Reuters     General Electric  Co  N GE  said
on Friday it took a  4 24 billion equity charge and reduced earnings
for the last two years by 30 cents a share  figures in line with
expectations the company set earlier this year when it said it would
comply with new accounting standards  The maker of power plants  jet
engines  medical devices and other industrial goods had estimated the
after tax  non cash impact would be about  4 2 billion  plus reduced
earnings for 2016 and 2017 of about 29 cents a share   The accounting
change prompted GE to recast two years of past financial statements to
reflect lower income and asset values under the new standard  and
those will be reflected when GE reports first quarter results on April
20   The value of GE s contract assets are being written down  but
that does not change the value of the long term contracts GE has  nor
does it affect GE s cash flow or earnings estimates for 2018  GE said
The adjustments appear within expectations  Edward Jones analyst Jeff
Windau said   Now the focus moves to next Friday s earnings   The
figures suggest GE executives have gotten to the bottom of some
accounting issues and bolster confidence in Chief Executive Officer
John Flannery after a series of financial surprises  including
underestimating the impact of insurance policies that prompted a  6 2
billion charge in the fourth quarter  analysts said   GE shares were
down 1 percent at  13 35 in aftermarket trading after rising 2 4
percent on Friday  The new accounting standard governs how companies
estimate and recognize revenue from long term contracts  and is
designed to make a company s cash flow more closely match its income
accounting experts and analysts said  The prior standard allowed
companies to recognize future revenue from such agreements more
quickly  The new standard shifts revenue to later in the contract
duration  analysts said  Companies typically use the cost of providing
services as a basis for estimating future revenue from the contracts
but the process can lead to over  or under estimating the value of the
contracts as assets on the balance sheet  experts say  GE s contract
asset tally has soared 70 percent to  28 8 billion in 2017  from  16 9
billion in 2014  most of it in its power and aviation units  The
majority of the total reflects revenue GE has already booked but for
which it has not billed customers  which creates the gap between
profit and cash flow  according to GE s regulatory filings  GE also
made adjustments for new accounting standards for pensions  cash flow
and taxes on Friday   GE s accounting is under scrutiny after earnings
swung to a loss last year and GE said its 2018 results would be at the
low end of its forecasted range of between  1 00 and  1 07 a share
The U S  Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into GE s
accounting for contract assets  raising investor concern but GE has
said it is not overly concerned about the investigation  GE said in
February that it expects to make the adjustments as it switches to the
new accounting standards for contracts    GE said it chose to restate
2016 and 2017 earnings  a more exacting standard under the new rules
because it will allow investors to compare 2018 results with the prior
years",2018-04-13,Reuters

the gap is a 45 percent slide in GE stock over 2017 and a 16 percent

106,Do you need a do over on your Roth conversion ,"By Gail MarksJarvis CHICAGO  Reuters     The opinions expressed here
are those of the author  a columnist for Reuters    If you turned a
traditional IRA into a Roth IRA in 2017  you may be kicking yourself
now  What seemed like a clever strategy a few months ago may not seem
so smart if your account value dropped  People do this kind of
conversion so they can escape paying taxes on investment growth down
the road  because Roth accounts grow tax free  According to the latest
IRS data available  taxpayers in 2015 converted about  4 3 billion
into Roths from IRAs  When you move the money  you have to pay income
tax on the amount based on the value of the stocks on the day you do
the conversion  That is because IRA contributions go in before taxes
and you pay income tax as you take the money out in retirement   If
you did a conversion in 2017 while stocks were soaring  you might want
to check in  Since the beginning of this year  stocks have been on a
wild ride  While the Standard   Poor s 500 has recovered from losses
and was up 2 percent for the year through Tuesday  your individual

return you could face an aggravating realization  You owe taxes on
sums that have evaporated  If you converted  100 000 in 2017 and the

you have until October 15  2018  to make it happen   Despite the
changes Congress made to get rid of recharacterizations starting on
Jan  1  2018  the new tax laws do not affect 2017 conversions    Going

traditional IRAs into Roth IRAs   you can do this even if you take a
do over on your 2017 conversion   Slott notes that doing a conversion
will be cheaper for most people in 2018 because they will be in lower
tax brackets   This is the time to get money into a Roth because taxes
are likely to go up in the future   Slott said    Yet  without the
right to change your mind in the future  he suggests moving slowly on
new conversions   possibly waiting until later in the year when you
know more about your possible investment declines  your annual income

Phoenix financial planner Alexander Koury is helping a 50 year old
client convert an IRA into a Roth IRA slowly  With a  2 million IRA
Koury is having a couple convert  250 000 each year for the next four
years into a Roth so only  1 million remains in the husband s
traditional IRA   Each year  they will owe about  50 000 more in taxes
based on the extra income  said Koury  But the  1 million Roth could
grow tax free to about  2 6 million  based on a modest 5 percent
return by the time he retires in 20 years   That is a huge benefit
that does not happen in traditional IRAs  With a traditional IRA
everything withdrawn to cover retirement spending will get taxed each

108,Caterpillar drives sales on China s new Silk Road,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Brenda Goh CHICAGO NANTONG  China  Reuters
At a  Caterpillar   NYSE CAT  facility in the eastern Chinese city of
Nantong  an array of excavators  earth movers and road making
machinery is displayed on slopes and in mud pits  The audience is
Caterpillar s local network of dealers  who inspect the machines for
the latest technological innovations to help make their sales pitches
to buyers in China   However  much of the heavy equipment could find
its way to construction and mining projects in places like Pakistan or
Kazakhstan  or as far away as Africa  Caterpillar has been investing
heavily in China   the Nantong facility is one of 25 similar ones it
has set up across the country   in the hopes of cracking the largest
construction and mining equipment market in the world  Helping fuel
the growth of that market  Caterpillar executives and analysts say  is
China s Belt and Road initiative  a huge infrastructure spending spree
that builds on the old Silk Road trading routes  The ambitious and
ever growing  1 trillion initiative now includes projects spanning
Asia  Europe  the Middle East and Africa   Belt and Road is becoming a
very important driver for Caterpillar s development   said Chen Qihua
head of Caterpillar China  at the Nantong facility  The world s
biggest equipment maker doesn t reveal its sales tied directly to Belt
and Road projects  or break out its China revenues   But analysts say
its Asia Pacific sales figures reflect demand for machines destined
for Belt and Road projects as contractors buy most of their equipment
in China to take advantage of tax rebates handed out for the
initiative  Chen said contractors prefer to buy machines in China to
take advantage of the rebates  Asia Pacific sales increased 22 percent
in the last quarter of 2017 over the previous year  with construction
demand in China accounting for about half that increase  Caterpillar
said in January  It said it expected demand to remain strong at least
through the first half of 2018   Graphic on Caterpillar s sales
Once purchased in China  the equipment is shipped off to projects
across the vast geography of the initiative and put to work building
power plants in Pakistan  constructing highways in Belarus or
developing new mines in Africa  Most of the equipment sent is made in
China  Chen said  Lawrence Poh  executive director at Caterpillar s
largest dealer in China  told Reuters at his office in Kunshan  just
outside Shanghai  that orders had increased due to demand from Belt
and Road projects  He did not provide details   COMPETITION While
China has been a bright spot for Caterpillar  it is facing competition
from cheaper construction equipment made by Chinese companies
particularly in China  Other Western companies such as  General
Electric   NYSE GE   Honeywell and Maersk are also vying for orders
particularly in the energy and transportation segment  Joshua Yau  a
Hong Kong based Belt and Road analyst at Strategy   an arm of the PwC
consultancy  says Chinese construction equipment companies like
Zoomlion and Sany Heavy Industries dominate sales inside China  But
Yau said that outside China  Caterpillar s advanced technology and
global network made it a better option   Caterpillar is mostly getting
the orders where Chinese equipment suppliers are not competitive
said Yau  He added that Chinese products were generally viewed as
inferior in terms of quality and technology  Caterpillar s sales pitch
is that its machines use less fuel and help construction teams work
faster  Advanced software helps track the machines  performance  and
when things go wrong it has a network of more than 170 dealers and 2
000 branches around the world to help with repairs   In the
geographies where they are newcomers  Chinese contractors can leverage
CAT s overseas network to help compete and win projects   Yau said  In
Africa  for instance  a piece of equipment sold by a China based
dealer for a project in Kenya or Algeria could be serviced by a
Caterpillar dealer on the continent   It s very easy for us to align
with other dealers   Poh said   Once our equipment goes abroad  they
will need to provide good maintenance and upkeep for the customer in
order to allow the equipment to perform at their best   Analysts said
a lack of overseas dealer networks and a perceived shortfall in
quality meant Chinese rivals were struggling to expand their share of
the global market   The low labour cost advantage associated with
these Chinese companies will hold less sway as products become
increasingly complex and quality standards significantly increase
analysts at Morningstar wrote in a recent note   Caterpillar is also
deploying its financing arm to spur Belt and Road sales  company
executives said  Since the launch of the initiative  the financing arm
has started lending to Chinese companies  including state owned
enterprises  to help bridge their funding gaps  Caterpillar does not
disclose specific data for such lending   MULTI YEAR BOOST Still  Belt
and Road is also providing opportunities for Chinese construction
companies  A study by Off Highway Research found that countries along
the Belt and Road accounted for 30 percent of Sany s overall sales in
2016 2017  At XCMG Construction Machinery  75 percent of overseas
sales came from countries associated with the initiative  Sales
figures were not provided  Analysts and Caterpillar executives say
Belt and Road  on which Beijing says it wants to spend as much as  150
billion a year outside China  offers ample opportunities for all
manufacturers    As government funding for the BRI projects improves
this is expected to result in higher demand throughout the industry

affairs at Caterpillar in Singapore  referring to the initiative",2018-03-04,Reuters

112,How General Electric gambled on fossil fuel power  and lost,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK  Reuters    Last March  executives at  General
Electric   NYSE GE  Co s power plant business gave Wall Street a
surprisingly bullish forecast for the year  Despite flat demand for
new natural gas power plants  they said  GE Power s revenue and profit
would rise  Showing data from financial firm Lazard and other sources
their presentation said natural gas  coal and even some nuclear power
plants were the lowest cost producers of electricity on the planet
cheaper than wind or solar    Gas is the most economical energy source
today   one slide read  In the days following the conference  GE s
shares rose 2 percent  But GE s forecast turned out to be a mirage
Rather than rising  GE Power s profit fell 45 percent last year
forcing GE to slash its overall profit outlook and cut its dividend
for only the second time since the Great Depression  Its shares have
plunged more than 50 percent since the March forecast  Former CEO Jeff
Immelt was replaced in August  John Flannery  GE s new chief executive
blamed the forecast  along with poor management and other factors  for
the power business meltdown  In January  he warned the pain would
continue this year  and potentially be worse than expected   What GE
has not emphasized is that wind and solar now cost substantially less
than gas and other conventional energy sources   and have for years
according to a widely respected energy cost report Lazard has
published since 2008  For graphic showing energy costs and other
details  click   GE said Lazard was one data source for its March
forecast  which also weighed the high efficiency of GE s latest gas
power plants and other factors  GE said cost  is not the only
predictor  of the power source utilities will choose  They may also
value the reliability of fossil fuels over wind and solar   We have a
rigorous financial planning process   GE said in response to questions
from Reuters  But according to more than a dozen former executives
rivals and energy experts interviewed by Reuters  GE s reading of the
market left the company deeply vulnerable to the sudden drop in demand
for conventional power plants  as sales of wind and solar surged
There are just fewer gas turbines being bought   one former GE
executive said   The market is not flat  it s down   Power is not GE s
only problem  Its financing arm  GE Capital  took a massive
unexpected charge that contributed to a nearly  10 billion loss in the
fourth quarter and prompted U S  regulators to broaden an ongoing
probe of its accounting practices  Profit also fell sharply at GE s
separate oil and gas and locomotive businesses last year  and Flannery
has suggested he may break up the company  But power is one of GE s
oldest and largest businesses  and supplied 60 percent of the
conglomerate s profit as recently as 2016  Now  GE is cutting 12 000
jobs  18 percent of the unit s workforce  after announcing 6 500 job
cuts in early 2016   On Wednesday  GE Chief Financial Officer Jamie
Miller warned of  a little bit more noise  at GE Power  calling 2018
a reset and stabilization year  for the division  She declined to
predict when GE Power would regain double digit profit margins it had
in 2016  and said turning it around  will take a good 12 to 18 months
DOUBLING DOWN GE doubled down on fossil fuel in 2015 with the  10 3
billion purchase of French group Alstom s power business  The deal
expanded GE s exposure to gas  coal and nuclear power just as solar
costs fell below those of gas powered plants  according to Lazard  The
Alstom   PA ALSO  deal added 65 000 employees to GE s payroll and
dozens of factories and service centers around the globe at a time
when GE was trying to cut costs   Orders for GE s newest  large gas
fired turbines have fallen 35 percent in the two years since the deal
closed  and industry estimates show demand for conventional plants is
unlikely to hit 2017 levels again for at least a decade   The cost gap
between renewable and conventional power is still widening  and some
utilities already are mothballing older fossil plants  using them only
to supplement wind and solar  Other companies also were hit by the
decline in sales  But competitors  Siemens  AG  DE SIEGn  and
Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems were cautious  Paul Browning  Chief
Executive of MHPS North America  said his company watched wind and
solar power costs fall 12 percent a year for more than a decade    We
did see a lot of this coming and didn t make acquisitions or build up
a lot of facilities  people or inventory   Browning said in an
interview  While Alstom gave GE more than  14 billion more in annual
revenue  Alstom s profit margins were less than one third of GE s
Immelt saw that as an opportunity    If we thought this was a 6
percent margin business that we couldn t dramatically improve  we are
not going to do it   Immelt said of the Alstom purchase in May 2014
We are basically in similar businesses in the same market  and we run
our business at a 20 percent margin   But regulators required GE to
sell the power plant service arm of Alstom  a Florida based company
called Power Systems Manufacturing that had long been a competitor to
GE  Mitsubishi and Siemens   GE  which had counted on that business
serving a large base of plants around the world to make Alstom more
profitable  bid aggressively on service deals to avoid losing them to
competitors  according to three people familiar with the bidding
That has raised concerns among investors that it is locked into
service contracts that will not be profitable  Rather than improving
Alstom s margins  GE Power s margin plunged to 7 7 percent last year
from 21 percent before the acquisition   In response to questions from
Reuters  GE said lucrative income from fixing downed power plants fell
by half last year  a major hit to profits  But it defended the Alstom
purchase  which instantly gave it 50 percent more plants to service
something that would take half a century to build up from scratch
Since it is a long term business  GE said  and  we have opportunity to
improve the performance in the future   LIGHTING UP THE WORLD    FOR
NOW GE s power plants generate one third of the world s electricity
giving it a large installed base for services revenue   But industry
experts point out that GE s gas power plants are mainly older F Class
units  rather than the new  larger H Class turbines  Older gas fired
plants often cannot compete with wind and solar  especially when
governments provide subsidies  said Stuart Slade  director of
consulting at market research firm Forecast International    There are
a lot of single cycle gas plants being mothballed   Slade said  Alstom
inflicted other blows  New Alstom orders fell off in the 18 months
before the deal closed as customers held back on purchases  That gave
competitors scope to gain market share  according to people familiar
with the sales competitions   GE has sold the largest number F Class
power plants  But it is in third place behind Mitsubishi and Siemens
in competition for the newest  largest and most fuel efficient H Class
turbines  according to McCoy Power Reports  an industry research
company  Orders for all of GE Power s plants and services have fallen
13 percent since 2016  a decline that accelerated at the end of last
year  GE also wrote off some of the equipment it built up as part of
an  850 million charge it took in the fourth quarter  GE did not rule
out further write offs  in response to questions from Reuters  Miller
and GE Power Chief Executive Russell Stokes have said the problems are
fixable  and the company acknowledged in a recent strategy paper that
wind and solar are a fast growing part of the world s energy supply
Still  GE downplays the threat to its bulked up fossil fuel product
line  Despite rapid growth of wind and solar  it says  two thirds of
power generation will come from gas  coal and nuclear plants over the
next decade    The transformation will not happen overnight   GE said
in the strategy paper",2018-02-22,Reuters

114,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in
financial markets on Monday  February 5  1  Global Bond Yields
Continue Higher  U S  10 Year Bond Hits 2 88  Global bond yields
continued this year s rally  as expectations of higher inflation and
talk of central bank policy tightening boosted borrowing costs  The U
S  10 year note rose to an intraday high of 2 883   a level not seen
since January 2014  It was last at 2 856   up 0 4 basis points  or
roughly 0 2   The benchmark yield has not been above 3  since late
2013 and some investors believe that level will be tested in the weeks
ahead amid expectations that an economy boosted by tax reform will
compel further policy tightening from the Federal Reserve this year
Meanwhile  in Europe  bond yields in Germany jumped  with the 10 year
Bund reaching multi year highs  bolstered by the view that the
European Central Bank is getting closer to ending its massive stimulus
program  Recent chatter that the world s leading central banks will
start tightening monetary policy faster than previously thought has
sparked a global bond market selloff this year  with yields in the U S
Europe and Asia all spiking higher  2  World Stocks Extend Biggest
Selloff In Two Years The worst selloff in world stocks in over two
years deepened  as expectations of rising inflation and a sudden climb
in government bond yields spooked investors  Asian equities were
covered in a sea of red  with Japan s Nikkei tumbling 2 5   its
biggest daily drop in 15 months  Benchmarks in Australia  South Korea
and Taiwan all suffered declines of over 1   In Europe  the continent
s bourses suffered a sharp selloff at the open  as weakness seen in
markets overseas weighed on sentiment  On Wall Street  U S  stock
futures pointed to a lower open  extending the rout equity markets
experienced on Friday when the benchmark S P 500 and Dow benchmarks
notched their worst week since early January 2016  Dow futures were
down nearly 120 points  or 0 5   while S P 500 and Nasdaq futures also
pointed to losses at the open  Rising bond yields can crimp demand for
assets perceived as riskier  such as stocks  particularly when those
yields are higher than those of equities  3  Dollar Pauses After Jobs
Report Gives It A Boost The U S  dollar paused against a basket of
currencies after rallying at the end of last week on upbeat U S  jobs
data  which showed wages last month recorded their largest annual gain
in more than 8 1 2 years  The data contributed to the sentiment that
inflation is picking up  laying some groundwork for potentially more
aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate hikes this year  The majority
of economists believe that the U S  central bank will hike rates three
times this year  However  the market is now adjusting to the
possibility that the Fed could raise rates four times in 2018  The
dollar index  which gauges the U S  currency against a basket of six
major rivals  stood little changed at 88 90  after rising 0 6  on

00AM ET  1500GMT   4  Bitcoin Prices Sink Below  8 000 Bitcoin prices
were on the backfoot  sinking to the lowest levels since November as a
selloff sparked by fears over tighter regulation of cryptocurrencies

exchange  It fell to as low as  7 751 at one point  the weakest level
since November 19  Ethereum  the world s second largest cryptocurrency
by market cap  was down 12  at  809 95  Meanwhile  Ripple s XRP token
was trading at  0 78100  down around 17  for the day  Bitcoin and
rival cryptocurrencies have been hit by a range of factors  including
fears over tighter regulation and ongoing concerns over digital
currency tether and its ability to collapse the bitcoin market  5  Oil

117,CFM says LEAP engine output four five weeks behind schedule,"DUBLIN  Reuters    CFM International is 4 5 weeks behind schedule in
producing its new LEAP jet engine for Airbus and Boeing jets  but
remains confident about ramping up output this year  Company
executives said it was also handling queries from planemakers about
potential further increases in demand  The engine maker  co owned by
General Electric   N GE  and France s  Safran   PA SAF   aims to
produce 1 100 1 200 of the fuel saving engines in 2018 after
delivering 459 last year  executives said on a media conference call
on Thursday  CFM  which supplies all engines for the Boeing  N BA  737
and competes with Pratt   Whitney  N UTX  to power the Airbus A320neo
is in the midst of a product changeover while handling higher than
expected demand for the older CFM56  The Cincinnati based venture is
working to catch up on production  but is meanwhile having to address
teething issues with the version of the LEAP 1A engine developed for
Airbus  CFM is about half way through overhauling some 70 LEAP 1A
engines after quality problems with a turbine disc  announced by
Safran last July  executive vice president Allen Paxson said  The
problem is different from one that disrupted flight tests of the
Boeing 737 MAX last year  but the part of the engine involved includes
some of the same suppliers  he added  A further problem with the
coating used on a part inside the Airbus version has triggered efforts
to allow the engines to stay on the wing for longer before they need
to be maintained  Deliveries of the competing Airbus A320neo family
have been delayed mainly by technical problems with the Geared
Turbofan engine from Pratt   Whitney  a unit of United Technologies  N
UTX   but also by industrial issues at CFM  Airbus says  CFM had
earlier targeted 1 200 deliveries this year  but executives said it
was not toning down its assessment of production capabilities or the
state of its huge supply chain  As LEAP engine production cranks up
and airlines respond to an unexpectedly strong rise in traffic numbers
CFM has been responding to higher demand for current generation
engines  Planemakers have meanwhile begun sounding out CFM about
pushing single aisle aircraft production plans higher  beyond their
targeted levels of up to 60 aircraft a month each for Airbus and
Boeing by 2019   We are answering requests of the airframers for
information about our ability to support possible higher rates  These
are nothing but the standard discussions we have with manufacturers
executive vice president Francois Bastin said  Industry sources say
Airbus is evaluating the case for raising A320 production as high as
70 jets a month  The industry is already accelerating at a record pace
on the back of demand led by emerging markets  but engine makers have
been particularly wary about overtaxing their suppliers  Air Lease  N
AL  Chairman Steven Udvar Hazy told the Airline Economics conference
in Dublin this week that current production plans were  realistic
barring a setback in demand  CFM said it had received orders for 3 444
engines worth  46 billion at list prices in 2017  including 2 870 LEAP
engines   It has so far won orders or commitments for 14 270 LEAP",2018-01-25,Reuters

120,GE says SEC investigating charge behind  10 billion loss,"By Alwyn Scott  Reuters     General Electric  Co  N GE  said on
Wednesday that U S  securities regulators are probing a massive
insurance charge it announced last week  a write off that produced a
10 billion loss in the latest quarter  It was the latest blow to the
nation s largest industrial conglomerate as it struggles to reverse
steep declines in its power  capital and transportation divisions   GE
also forecast more weakness at its power business this year  a unit
that produced 60 percent of GE s profits as recently as 2016   GE
affirmed its outlook for earnings of  1 to  1 07 a share in 2018  But
some analysts were skeptical  having expected GE to lower the target
in light of the insurance charge  suspension of GE Capital dividends
and weakness in power   GE also tried to tamp down talk about a break
up of the company  Chief Executive John Flannery said GE will continue
to exist as a company   but it will look different  as it sheds about
20 billion in assets and looks for the best structure to support its
core business of power  aviation and healthcare   We really like the
franchises we have in all three   Flannery said in remarks echoing
another executive  GE s disclosure of a U S  Securities and Exchange
Commission investigation likely worried investors  even though some
analysts saw it as all but inevitable following a 43 percent drop in
GE stock over the past year   If nothing else  board governance will
be heightened and the auditors will sharpen the effort   said Scott
Davis  analyst at Melius Research  GE said the probe began in late
November and focused on the long term service agreements for
maintenance of power plants  jet engines and other industrial
equipment  The SEC recently expanded the inquiry to include a  6 2
billion charge and  15 billion in provisions for insurance policies
that GE announced last week  GE said  GE did not provide further
details  but said it is cooperating with the investigation   It s very
early days   Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller said on a conference
call with analysts  adding  there s nothing here I m overly concerned
about    STARK DECLINE  While the fourth quarter results contained no
other sizeable charges  they threw into stark relief how far the U S
industrial conglomerate had veered from its outlook less than a year
ago  when former Chief Executive Jeff Immelt predicted that sales
would rise as much as 5 percent in 2017 and margins would expand by a
full percentage point  In fact  GE said  sales fell 1 percent to  122
1 billion in 2017 and operating profit margins contracted by 5 7
percentage points to 5 7 percent  The results also indicated that GE s
painful turnaround  which has sent its stock down 43 percent over the
last year  likely has more months to run   Shares were down 2 percent
at  16 55 in morning trading in New York  The stock had gained earlier
in part on relief that the company reaffirmed its 2018 profit forecast
RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray said in a note to clients
Some short covering could be triggered just on the news that GE
reaffirmed 2018  but the gravity of its operating challenges
especially at Power   are likely to continue to pressure the stock
over the near term   he wrote  GE kept unchanged its recent forecast
for 2018 earnings of between  1 00 and  1 07 a share  which contrasts
markedly with the  2 a share that Immelt had promised before being
replaced as CEO in August  POWER FAILURE GE s weakening performance
largely reflected faster deterioration in GE s power business  where
profit fell 88 percent in the quarter  after a 51 percent drop in the
third quarter  The division  which makes and services electricity
generating equipment  attributed the drop to unspecified charges and
other factors   GE said the power market remains challenging  Revenue
and orders also fell sharply at the power business  The aviation
healthcare and renewable energy divisions reported rising profit
while profits in oil and gas and transportation fell  GE said cash
from industrial operating activities totaled  7 8 billion in the
quarter  above expectations of about  7 billion  and GE said its
ability to generate cash is improving  GE s loss totaled  10 01
billion in the quarter  compared with a profit of  3 48 billion a year
earlier   On a per share basis  GE reported a loss from continuing
operations of  1 15  compared with a profit of 39 cents per share  GE
said last week it would book a  11 billion charge in the fourth
quarter  including  6 2 billion for reevaluation of insurance assets
The insurance charge was double what GE had warned last year   Total
revenue in the quarter fell to  31 40 billion from  33 09 billion",2018-01-24,Reuters

122,Pakistan s PM says confident GE will fix  technical  issues with gas turbines,"By Drazen Jorgic and Kay Johnson ISLAMABAD  Reuters    Prime Minister
Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said on Monday that some of General Electric s
flagship new gas turbines in Pakistan were still suffering from
technical issues such as  vibration  but he was confident the American
company will fix the problems  The 9HA class gas turbines are GE power
division s newest and most prestigious product but last year a series
of delays and outages interrupted their installation in three power
stations vital to Pakistan s efforts to end electricity shortfalls  GE
N GE  has described last year s problems as  teething  issues  but the
troubles have frustrated Pakistani officials and concerned analysts
GE  undergoing a restructuring  saw its share price tumble below  16
on Monday for the first time since 2011  Former petroleum minister
Abbasi told Reuters it was normal for problems to arise in large
projects with new technology but he had faith in GE to fix the
problems   There have been technical issues  GE is working to resolve
them  and there are issues that remain today  Some have been solved
some are still there  Those will get resolved   Abbasi told Reuters in
an interview in the prime minister s chamber in Pakistan s Parliament
in the capital Islamabad   I m very confident that these will be very
robust plants that will be a flagship for both GE and Pakistan   The
Pakistani power plants are being upgraded to operate at 1 200 MW
combined cycle  having worked in simple cycle mode   delivering around
800 MW per power plant   for much of 2017  Abbasi did not elaborate on
how many of the six turbines operating in three 1 200 MW power plants
were suffering installation difficulties   Some have vibration issues
some have technical issues  GE is working on that   said Abbasi  who
is a trained engineer    These  power plants  are still with the EPC
engineering  procurement and construction  contractor under GE s
supervision  so we don t have any liability for them at the moment
China s Harbin Electric International Company and SEPCOIII Electric
Power Construction Corporation are the contractors building the power
stations   In response to Abbasi s remarks  a GE spokesperson pointed
to a statement the company issued to Reuters in December about last
year s problems   Together we ve encountered and communicated openly
about launch challenges and readily resolved issues during this time
it s important to note that challenges are common with power plants of
this size and complexity during the commissioning and early operations
phase   GE said in the statement   We remain committed to supporting
customer and site needs with the highest standards of quality and
excellence   GE added  The 9HA class gas turbines entered the Guinness
World Records for efficiency  based on the amount of electricity
generated from natural gas at the power plant in Bouchain  France
where it was first put into commercial operation in 2016  Pakistan
ordered six turbines in 2015   GE s record efficiency of 62 2 percent

125,Rolls Royce shares jump as commercial marine business goes on block,"By Paul Sandle LONDON  Reuters    Rolls Royce  L RR  is considering
the sale of its loss making commercial marine business in another
shake up by Chief Executive Warren East that will streamline its
activities into civil aerospace  defense and power system units  East
had resisted selling the marine business  which has been hit by weak
offshore oil and gas markets  saying its technology was relevant to
other parts of Rolls  The business  which is largely based in the
Nordics  had  responded admirably  to the downturn by cutting its cost
base  he said  but the case for new investment was  challenging    It
is only right that we consider whether its future may be better served
under new ownership   he said  Shares in the company jumped to a 10
week high after it said the loss making business could be sold  They
were trading up almost 6 percent at 902 6 pence at 1420 GMT  topping
the FTSE 100 index  East said he had previously had to deal with
urgent priorities at Rolls Royce  including introducing new engines
and doubling production rates of its engines for wide body jets
before ordering a review of marine   We needed to stabilize the
business and deliver on the initial simplification to restore trust
he told reporters  The marine business generated a loss of 27 million
pounds on sales of 1 1 billion pounds in 2016  with the bulk of the
business supplying equipment and vessel design across the oil and gas
merchant and other commercial markets   The loss widened in Rolls
Royce s first half to 17 million pounds  when it said the market
outlook remained challenging  SECOND OVERHAUL East said the review was
consistent with his previous comments that not everything in the unit
was core    Some of the activities are very useful to us from a future
technology point of view   he said  such as automation  But activities
like vessel design could be sold off  Bankers said GE  N GE   Wartsila
HE WRT1V  and  Siemens   DE SIEGn  were possible buyers  Finance Chief
Stephen Daintith said there was interest in the business  but it was
too early to talk about the value of a deal before the review  which
is being done by Lazard  concludes    Marine  has gone through a lot
of restructuring   East said   It is well placed for a turnaround in
its markets  it s just that the visibility around that is uncertain
East said the naval shipping business would move into an expanded
defense unit   The major overhaul  East s second since he became CEO
in 2015  will also see the elimination of its nuclear division  with
nuclear submarine systems moving into defense and civil nuclear
activities moving into power systems  East said the changes would
enable the company to respond more quickly to the needs of its
customers and reduce costs   It will create a Defence operation with
greater scale in the market  enabling us to offer our customers a more
integrated range of products and services   he said    It will also
strengthen our ability to innovate in core technologies and enable us
to take advantage of future opportunities in areas such as
electrification and digitalization   East  who has already stripped
out layers of management at Rolls  said the restructuring would remove
some duplication  but it was too early to quantify job losses   Cost
savings  beyond the 200 million pounds a year it targeted in 2015  and
other details about the restructuring will be given in its full year

126,GE renews break up talk after  11 billion insurance  tax hit,"By Alwyn Scott and Ankit Ajmera  Reuters     General Electric   NYSE
GE  Co again raised the prospect of breaking up the conglomerate on
Tuesday as it announced more than  11 billion in charges from its long
term care insurance portfolio and new U S  tax laws  Chief Executive
John Flannery has previously raised the idea of selling pieces of the
largest U S  industrial company  as he slashes thousands of jobs and
moves to cut  3 5 billion in costs to counter a plunge in profits and
cash flow   Flannery inherited a host of problems when he became CEO
on Aug  1  such as falling sales of power turbines  a build up of
inventory and declining profit margins in some businesses   His
statements on Tuesday showed that the idea of a break up remains part
of GE s thinking  though not a certainty    I would categorize it as
an examination of options and it s  the  kind of thing that could
result in many  many different permutations  including separately
traded assets really in any one of our units  if that s what made
sense   he said in response to an analyst question on a conference
call  without giving any details  GE said it will provide another
update on its review in the spring  A decision could come then  CNBC
reported  citing sources close to GE  adding that a break up was
likely   Earlier on Tuesday  GE said its finance arm  GE Capital
would take a  7 5 billion after tax charge in the fourth quarter from
a reevaluation of its insurance assets  It will also take a  1 8
billion charge for non cash impairments at GE Capital   We ve seen
this movie before  with GE  said Deane Dray  an analyst at RBC Capital
Markets   They say they re adequately reserved until they re not  And
then you see a parade of incremental reserve charges   GE shares were
down 3 9 percent at  18 03 in afternoon trading  At that level  the
company has a market capitalization of about  156 billion   INSURANCE
RETHINK The insurance charge is the latest sign of problems with the
modeling and funding of nursing home and other long term care in the
United States   GE said it reviewed policy assumptions with actuaries
and accountants after seeing that payouts had begun to exceed premiums
on a portfolio of about 300 000 policies that stem from businesses GE
acquired in the 1980s and 1990s  GE sold most of those business last
decade and has not written such policies since 2006   The review
concluded a week ago  showed GE needed to set aside  15 billion
through 2024  including  3 billion in the current quarter  to cover
potential payouts on the policies it retained    Clearly  in hindsight
we under appreciated the risk   Flannery said  GE Capital last year
temporarily suspended paying dividends to GE  Now  GE Capital will
suspend its dividend for the  foreseeable future  to help fund the
reserve  GE said  The problem was flagged in July when GE said
adverse claims  were appearing in part of its long term care portfolio
and it was assessing how much policy holders would likely pay   TAX
CHANGE CHARGE Tax changes recently passed by the U S  Congress raised
GE s fourth quarter charge to  7 5 billion  more than twice an initial
indication of more than  3 billion that GE had noted in November  GE
also will record a  3 4 billion impact from tax reform and  1 8
billion in goodwill and other non cash impairments  all in the fourth
quarter  The charges means GE s 2017 profit will be at the bottom end
of its forecast  GE said   Flannery said in November that GE would
pare its operations to three main businesses   power  healthcare and
aviation   and seek to dispose of  20 billion in operations  He also
said further major portfolio changes were being considered  Asked how
his strategy had evolved since November  Flannery said    We ve been
taking a comprehensive look at every aspect of the company and that
everything was on the table  So that s been  I d say  a hallmark of
our approach from day one    GE said the Kansas Insurance Department
the primary regulator for North American Life   Health  GE Capital s
insurance portfolio   had approved the phased  15 billion reserve
payments through 2024   The set aside highlights long running
difficulties for long term care insurers and re insurers who are
struggling to make good on policies dating back decades that
underestimated projected health care costs and life spans  The cost of
nursing home or home based elderly care tends not to be covered by
Medicare  the U S  government insurance program  and can be extremely
expensive out of pocket  GE was the worst performer on the Dow in 2017
and it has already cut its planned annual dividend for 2018 in half
only the third cut in the company s 125 year history   Even after the
stock s declines  it trades at only a slight discount to industrial
peers  trading at about 18 times this year s expected earnings",2018-01-16,Reuters

problems  But the questions over one of its most important products
suggest another setback for the company in a year in which its shares
have plunged and third quarter results were called  horrible  by new
Chief Executive John Flannery  GE is now undergoing major
restructuring   There is no evidence that GE s 9HA Class turbines have
fundamental design flaws  But so far the Pakistani plants  which began
running this year  are producing power at levels well below their
capacity and the problem was acute in the crucial summer months  when
temperatures in the country frequently exceed 40 degrees Celsius  104
F   Data from Pakistan s Central Power Purchasing Agency  seen by
Reuters  showed the Bhikki  Haveli and Balloki plants jointly
generated only a half of their current maximum capacity in August   A
month later all three plants showed improved output but remained well
below capacity  Reuters was unable to review more recent data   It had
terrible consequences because we lost a lot of power which would have
come to the grid during the peak summer   Yousaf Naseem Khokhar  the
top civil servant in the Energy Ministry s power division  told
Reuters   It is now up to  General Electric   NYSE GE  to rise to the
challenge and to take care of these issues    before next summer
starts   he said  In a statement sent to Reuters  GE said  every
commercial HA site today is demonstrating exceptional performance
levels for both output and efficiency   On the issues in Pakistan  GE
said   We ve encountered and communicated openly about launch
challenges and readily resolved issues during this time  It s
important to note that challenges are common with power plants of this
size and complexity during the commissioning and early operations
phase   GE also said in a separate statement that the three plants are
expected to deliver enough power to supply the equivalent of 7 3
million Pakistani homes over their 30 plus year life cycle  and that
will make a  meaningful difference in the everyday lives of the people
of Pakistan   The 9HA class gas turbines  the GE power division s
newest and most prestigious product  entered the Guinness World
Records last year for efficiency  based on the amount of electricity
generated from natural gas at the power plant in Bouchain  France
where it was first put into commercial operation in June last year
Both the 9HA and the 7HA turbines   the A stands for air cooled   are
in tough competition with similar products made by Germany s  Siemens
DE SIEGn   Japan s Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems   a joint venture
between Mitsubishi Heavy Industries  T 7011  and Hitachi  T 6501
and Italy s state controlled Ansaldo Energia  Flannery said in a GE
investor presentation in November that  resolving initial launch
issues  with HA class gas turbines would be a future priority  TOUGH
YEAR GE s shares have fallen more than 40 percent this year  and the
125 year old company announced this month it was cutting 12 000 jobs
in its power division  about a fifth of the workforce  to cut costs
Operating profit of the power division  once the strongest part of GE
s operations  fell 51 percent in the third quarter against the year
ago period  Flannery said the division  which brought in 28 percent of
GE s revenue last year  was  challenged  but could be turned around in
one or two years  Pakistan  desperate for additional electricity to
avoid crippling blackouts  teamed up with GE to build the power
stations at Bhikki  Haveli and Balloki  all in the most populous
province Punjab  at breakneck speed   GE won the contracts to supply
Pakistan with six turbines for the three power plants in 2015  based
on the lowest priced deal per megawatt of capacity   The first problem
was the deliveries were delayed by up to three months and missed some
of the summer months this year  several Pakistani officials said  They
said they were told the delays happened because a part of the turbine
needed further testing   The plan was to fire up the turbines in
simple cycle mode   delivering around 800 MW per power plant   in the
spring of 2017 and then to upgrade to 1 200 MW combined cycle output
after the summer  The delays infuriated Islamabad  because getting
additional power during the summer was a crucial factor ahead of 2018
parliamentary elections  One of the two turbines at the Bhikki power
plant was delayed by about a month  At the Balloki and Haveli plants
the turbines were delayed by about three months  two senior Pakistani
officials aware of the situation said  Then  in early May  a
combustion seal leak was detected at one of the turbines at the Bhikki
plant   To fix this  and to apply the same remedy to the five other
turbines  GE airlifted all the units to France for repairs  Pakistan s
Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi  who was then the petroleum
minister  told Reuters in July that GE spared no expense to fix the
problems   They found the problem  they took out the part  they went
back to the vendor  they re machined them  they came back   all on
dedicated transport flights   Abbasi said   TURBINE DAMAGE But that
meant one Bhikki turbine was offline for about 40 days and the other
for about 50 days  The other two plants had not begun operations at
the time  but came online in July and August   In a third setback  one
of the turbines at the Haveli plant was badly damaged during a power
outage three weeks after it was inaugurated in July  the Pakistani
officials said   At such times  batteries and a generator act as back
ups to ensure a pump continues to push lube oil into the turbine
Both didn t work   said one of the Pakistani officials  adding the
diesel generator had no fuel  The turbine crashed  with damage
estimated at  33 million  and although it was refitted with a new
rotor by GE  it is still to resume operations   The power station is
being built by China s SEPCOIII Electric Power Construction
Corporation  SEPCOIII did not return queries for comment    GE and
SEPCOIII are working together to determine the cause behind the loss
of functionality of the planned backup power system   GE said in a
statement   A senior Pakistani official in Islamabad said the delays
and outages had cast GE in a bad light    Frankly speaking  they have
lost a lot of credibility here in the government because of these
plants   the official said  In September  Pakistan awarded its most
recent power contract to Siemens  after bidding by several companies
including GE  Stephen Tusa  an analyst at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New
York  wrote in a recent note that although GE has assured investors
that the Pakistan problems have been resolved  they could re emerge in
other plants around the world   The risk is that if these issues are
not remedied  GE has already  sold  another around 30 units  around 10
plus of which are in operation   some of which are at higher output
ratings   he wrote   Remedies would have to be applied up the curve
something we view as a challenge  especially as senior management
tries to cut costs aggressively  Stay tuned   FORCED OUTAGES Not
everyone is complaining  even when performance isn t perfect  In
France  the Bouchain plant suffered 26 forced outages in the 15 months
ending November  according to data published by operator Electricite
de France  EDF   PA EDF    Despite these unplanned outages  GE and
operator EDF  with whom GE has a long standing alliance  say they are
satisfied   The cause of these events varies  and in certain cases a
single event has been interpreted as multiple events  It would not be
accurate to link this number to HA technology as fewer than 10 of
these events were related to the gas turbine   GE and EDF said in a
joint statement  In a another joint statement  the two said  the
Bouchain facility is an example of our HA technology at its very best
They added   During the commissioning and early operations phase  we
encountered minor issues that are very typical of what you d expect
with a project of this size  but we worked together to quickly resolve
them     GRAPHIC  GE vs Siemens 2017 share price performance",2017-12-27,Reuters

131,Tax loss selling to pressure 2017 s losers in December,"By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK  Reuters    Stocks that have been
lackluster so far in 2017 are unlikely to see their fortunes reversed
in the final month of the year  as investors engage in tax harvesting
practices before the new year   Investors often exercise tax loss
selling strategies  dumping stocks that have performed poorly in order
to reduce or eliminate capital gains taxes  as the year draws to a
close   This is something we do every December  we take losses for
clients who we ve created gains for   said Jake Dollarhide  chief
executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa  Oklahoma
Your clients want their cake and they want to eat it too   so they
want to see an 8 to 12 percent return in any given year and they d
like to also not have to pay capital gains taxes    Tax overhaul
negotiations in Washington have also added a potential wrinkle this
year  as investors may wait until a clearer picture emerges  An
investor seeking to divest a stock from their portfolio may hold off
until January to delay paying taxes until the following year    There
are a lot of people waiting on tax reform to make those decisions
said Ken Polcari  director of the NYSE floor division at O Neil
Securities in New York  Stocks that were among the worst performing on
the benchmark S P 500 index in 2016 saw losses mount in the final
month of that year  TripAdvisor  O TRIP  fell 4 percent in December
before closing the year with a loss of nearly 46 percent  Vertex
Pharmaceuticals  O VRTX  dropped nearly 10 percent for the month to
close out the year with a decline of 41 5 percent   That selling has
often led to what is referred to by market participants as the
January effect   when stocks  particularly smallcap names  that may
have been sold in December for tax harvesting  experience a rebound
the following month   Investors are prevented from selling shares for
tax harvesting purposes and buying them  or shares in a similar stock
within 30 days by an Internal Revenue Service regulation against what
is known as a  wash sale   That wait period helps create a lag before
the beaten down stocks rebound   BUYING OPPORTUNITIES However
identifying stocks that may be potential buying opportunities because
of tax harvesting strategies has become more difficult   Many mutual
funds share a fiscal year end date at the conclusion of October and
may start to sell for tax purposes in September  In addition
investors have become attuned to the practice and no longer limit the
selling to December   Tax loss selling is like holiday shopping  it
happens earlier and earlier every year   said Nicholas Colas  co
founder at DataTrek Research in New York  At the start of 2017
TripAdvisor bounced back with a 14 1 percent rally for January  and
Vertex surged 16 6 percent compared with the 1 8 percent S P 500  SPX
gain for the month   Among smallcap names  Mirati Therapeutics  O MRTX
tumbled 11 2 percent in December 2016 en route to a drop of about 85
percent for the year  The stock rebounded sharply at the start of 2017
with a jump of over 7 percent in January   Among the worst performers
for the year on the S P 500   Under Armour   N UAA  and Range
Resources  N RRC  have slumped more than 50 percent  while Signet
Jewelers  N SIG  and  General Electric   N GE  have lost more than 40
percent  On a sector basis  energy has struggled across the market cap
spectrum for the year   Further complicating matters this year was the
strong performance registered by equities in September and October
While those two months are historically a difficult time for the stock
market  the S P 500 rose roughly 2 percent in September and October
while the smallcap Russell 2000 index  RUT  jumped 6 percent in
September and tacked on another 0 8 percent in October     This year
we had pretty good performance in September and October   said Steve

134,General Electric to cut 12 000 jobs in power business revamp,"By John Revill and Alwyn Scott ZURICH LAS VEGAS  Reuters     General
Electric  Co  N GE  said Thursday it is axing 12 000 jobs at its
global power business  the struggling industrial conglomerate s latest
effort to shrink itself into a more focused company  The U S  company
launched the cuts to save  1 billion in 2018 at its Power business
saying it expects dwindling demand for fossil fuel power plants to
continue  GE s cuts follow a decision by rival  Siemens  AG  DE SIEGn
to slash 6 900 jobs in the face of a global shift by electric
utilities away from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy such
as wind and solar   GE did not give a breakdown of the job cuts  which
represent about 4 percent of its overall workforce of 295 000  saying
only that they would be primarily outside the United States  The cuts
represent about 18 percent of GE s Power business  GE said  The
announcement cast a spotlight on GE s decision to spend 9 7 billion
euros   10 7 billion when the deal closed in 2015  on the energy
business of France s  Alstom   PA ALSO   The deal rounded out GE Power
s portfolio by adding steam and nuclear capabilities to its mainly
natural gas turbine power business   But the purchase came just as
demand for new power plants was slowing  in part due to competition
from wind and solar systems   Traditional power markets including gas
and coal have softened   GE said on Thursday  explaining the decision
for the job cuts   Rumors of sweeping job cuts were confirmed by labor
union sources on Wednesday  with staff in Switzerland  Germany and
Britain among those badly hit   Unite  the largest trade union in
Britain and Ireland  said the announcement put 1 100 jobs at risk and
it vowed to fight against any compulsory layoffs in the UK   GE risks
cutting too far  too fast   to deal with the changing power market
But GE said the cuts were essential  since sales of new power plants
are falling  Industry estimates expect sales of about 110 to 120 new
gas powered turbines a year  but capacity at GE and other major
suppliers is about four times that    This decision was painful but
necessary for GE Power to respond to the disruption in the power
market  which is driving significantly lower volumes in products and
services   said Russell Stokes  head of GE Power    Power will remain
a work in progress in 2018  We expect market challenges to continue
but this plan will position us for 2019 and beyond    A senior GE
executive said jobs in France would not be hit because of an agreement
when GE purchased Alstom  GE shares  part of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average  DJI   were up 1 4 percent at  17 92 in midday trading

In Thursday s layoffs  nearly a third of the company s 4 500 strong
Swiss workforce could be cut  while 16 percent of staff in Germany are
also likely to be axed  GE said it had begun talks with labor leaders
about the steps  Union leaders in Germany reacted angrily to the job
cuts   The announcement by GE that it wants to cut thousands of jobs
across Europe is neither strategically nor economically justifiable
said Klaus Stein  the representative of the IG Metall Union at GE s
plant in Mannheim   We are not going to accept this  and we will fight
to preserve jobs   Demand for new thermal power plants dramatically
dropped in all rich countries  GE said  while traditional utility
customers have reduced their investments due to market deterioration
and uncertainty about future climate policy measures    Hardly any new
power station projects had been commissioned in Germany in recent
years  GE said  Heightened Asian competition had also increased price
pressures",2017-12-07,Reuters

136,Crude Oil Prices Fall In Asia On Profit Taking  Seasonal Demand Swings,"Investing com   Crude oil prices fell in Asia on Monday amid some
expected profit taking on the OPEC led output curb extension that was
widely welcomed by the market as the market looks ahead to seasonal
demand changes as winter gets underway in the Northern Hemisphere
Brent crude futures  the benchmark for oil prices outside the U S
fell 0 50  to  63 30 a barrel  U S  West Texas Intermediate  WTI
crude futures dipped 0 81  to  57 89   At face value  the normalized
inventory target remains bullish relative to our expectations with a
target of 5 year average inventory levels which does not take into
account rising demand or infrastructure oil    Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS
said in a client note  Last week  oil finished higher on Friday  with
prices climbing back toward their best level since July 2015 after
OPEC and other crude producers agreed to extend existing output cuts
until the end of 2018 to tighten global supplies  The Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC   along with some non OPEC
producers led by Russia  agreed on Thursday to extend current oil
output cuts for a further nine months until the end of next year  as
expected They also signaled a possible early exit from the deal should
the market overheat and prices rise too far  The deal to cut oil
output by 1 8 million barrels a day  bpd  was adopted last winter by
OPEC  Russia and nine other global producers  The agreement was due to
end in March 2018  having already been extended once  The OPEC led
production cuts have been one of the key catalyst supporting the
recent rally in oil prices amid expectations that rebalancing in crude
markets are well underway  However  fears that rising U S  output
would dampen OPEC s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies are
prevented prices from rising much further  according to market
participants  U S  energy companies added two oil rigs in the week to
Dec  1  bringing the total count up to 749  the highest since
September   General Electric   NYSE GE  s Baker Hughes energy services
firm said in its closely followed report on Friday  Domestic U S
output has rebounded by almost 15  since the most recent low in mid
2016  and increasing drilling activity for new production means output
is expected to grow further  as producers are attracted by climbing
prices  U S  oil production hit a new record of 9 68 million bpd last
week  according to government data released during the week  bringing
U S  output close to levels of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia
On the demand side  Senate Republicans narrowly passed a bill to
overhaul the U S  tax system in the wee hours of Saturday  The GOP
still needs to overcome significant differences for the House and
Senate to craft a joint bill in a process called resolution and send
it to Trump s desk  Republicans hope to reach a deal by Christmas
Goldman Sachs said the Senate version led it to revise growth
forecasts   We have increased our estimate of the growth effects of
the legislation slightly  to around 0 3pp in 2018 and 2019   Goldman
said in a note to clients   This reflects the slightly larger amount
of tax cuts in the Senate plan following revisions  and our
expectations regarding the eventual compromise   Elsewhere  ABC News
reported on Friday that Michael Flynn  the former White House national
security advisor  would testify that he was directed to make contact
with Russians during the presidential campaign in 2016  Flynn pleaded
guilty to lying to the FBI about his post election contacts with
Russia s ambassador to the U S  The ABC report was later corrected the
story to say its source had clarified that Trump gave Flynn the
directive  shortly after the election  to discuss strategies for
fighting the Islamic State extremist group",2017-12-03,Investing.com

138,Siemens to cut 6 900 jobs to tackle flailing turbines business,"By Georgina Prodhan and Christoph Steitz FRANKFURT  Reuters
Siemens   DE SIEGn  will cut about 6 900 jobs  or close to 2 percent
of its global workforce  mainly at its power and gas division  which
has been hit by the rapid growth of renewables  Most of the cuts
about 6 100  will be made before 2020 at Siemens s Power and Gas
division  which once thrived on supplying large gas turbines for
electricity generation but has been overtaken by the global surge in
solar and wind capacity   The power generation industry is
experiencing disruption of unprecedented scope and speed   Siemens
management board member Lisa Davis said   With their innovative
strength and rapidly expanding generation capacity  renewables are
putting other forms of power generation under increasing pressure
she added  Siemens  Process Industries and Drives division  which
makes large mechanical drives for oil and gas extraction and turbines
will also be hit  Siemens said  not ruling out forced layoffs as part
of the plan  Aside from loss making wind power venture Siemens  Gamesa
MC SGREN   Process Industries and Drives was Siemens s least
profitable business last quarter  with a profit margin of just 2 9
percent  Siemens said roughly half of the job cuts would be made in
Germany  a move likely to be unpopular with politicians currently
trying to form a government  It did not specify the costs of the
layoffs  IG Metall  Germany s largest trade union  lashed out at
management  accusing Siemens of having been to late in responding to
the crisis in conventional power generation and demanding no forced
redundancies be implemented   Job cuts of this magnitude are totally
unacceptable given the company is in an outstanding overall position
said IG Metall board member Juergen Kerner  who also sits on Siemens s
supervisory board  German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries urged
Siemens to treat employees fairly   The workers are very concerned and
uncertain about their future  I hope that Siemens works closely with
the unions to find fair solutions for the affected sites   She said
particularly sites in structurally weak regions should be preserved
BURNING TO THE GROUND  In contrast to arch rival  General Electric   N
GE   Siemens was able to shield itself from a sharp downturn in demand
for large turbines thanks to an 8 billion euro   9 billion  order for
power generation in Egypt   the largest in its history   which has
kept its German factories humming for the past two years  As that
order has now been fulfilled  both groups find themselves staring into
a future of vast overcapacity  where supply outstrips demand by a
ratio of three to one  and prices have dropped 30 percent since 2014
Demand for powerplant sized gas turbines has tumbled and is expected
to bottom out at 110 turbines a year  compared with total global
manufacturing capacity of around 400 turbines  Siemens said   The
market is burning to the ground   Siemens board member Janina Kugel
who is in charge of group human resources  told journalists in a call
following the announcement  General Electric on Monday announced a
halving of both its dividend and its 2018 earnings outlook  largely
due to its flailing turbines business  which it acknowledged it had
mismanaged as it underestimated the scale of the problem  It was only
the third time in the group s 125 year history that GE had lowered its
dividend  with previous cuts during the Great Depression of the 1930s
and last decade s financial crisis  GE is also selling large parts of
its empire to focus on power  aviation and healthcare  Siemens employs
about 16 000 people in power generation in Germany  roughly a third of
its global workforce in that business  including service",2017-11-16,Reuters

Co shares stabilized after a brutal slide last week sent the stock
near six year lows  but the worst may not be over  Some investors
still do not see enough value to warrant buying the shares  which have
lost some of their luster as a blue chip investment  They are sorting
through massive changes announced by GE s new Chief Executive John
Flannery last Monday  hugely reduced near term profit growth prospects
a halved dividend  and a wave of promised divestitures    In a sense
the stock is trying to find an investor   said Scott Lawson  vice
president of Westwood Holdings Group in Dallas  who follows industrial
stocks  as the stock was sliding last week   That investor is not a
growth guy  because they are not growing  It s not a value guy
because they re not cheap on the value metrics    The massive decline
for the stock   more than 40 percent this year   suggests that it
would pique the interest of value players   GE shares fell to  17 90
their lowest closing price since December 2011  after dropping 12 6
percent over Monday and Tuesday  their biggest two day decline since
the financial crisis  The stock edged back up over the rest of the
week and closed Friday at  18 21 amid news that Flannery had bought
about  1 1 million worth of the stock   But GE shares have not fallen
enough for some investors    What we are looking for is a sufficient
margin of safety to reasonable intrinsic value  and at the current
stock price  we just don t think the margin of safety is there
Michael Kon  portfolio manager with Golub Group in San Mateo
California  said as the stock hovered around  18   Kon said he was
looking either for the stock to fall further or for better than
expected improvement in GE s power turbine division before any
investment   Investment advisory firm Alan B  Lancz   Associates
bought some GE shares last week as the stock dipped into the  17 range
seeing value in the company s assets  which also include remaining
major businesses in jet engines and healthcare  said Alan Lancz
president of the Toledo  Ohio based firm   But Lancz said he sees GE
as an investment with a three  to five year payoff and acknowledged
the stock may fall further before that    We don t see any short term
intermediate term catalysts but we think that there is value there
Lancz said   It s not high on our list of buys  but it is something
that  I think for the long term  it can be accumulated here   One
question facing investors is how to assess the company against its
rivals   Over the past 20 years  GE on average has traded at 19 times
earnings estimates for the next 12 months  according to Thomson
Reuters Datastream  That is well above the average of 15 4 times for
rival diversified manufacturers Honeywell International Inc  NYSE HON
and United Technologies Corp  NYSE UTX  over that time   Following the
stock s slide this year  including fallout from third quarter
financial results last month that Flannery himself called
unacceptable   GE now trades at a discount to those companies  16 9
times forward earnings estimates against 17 3 times for  United Tech
and 19 times for Honeywell    It is going to take a long time before
you can clear the cloud and maybe get GE back to a comparable
valuation level with respect to other similar companies   said Chip
Pettengill  portfolio manager at Bahl   Gaynor Investment Counsel in
Cincinnati  Pettengill calls GE a  tarnished blue chip stock   GE s
earnings power is stronger than the  trough   or bottom  projected for
2018  said Scott Schermerhorn  chief investment officer at Granite
Investment Advisors in Concord  New Hampshire  who sees the shares
particularly discounted to other industrial companies based on
enterprise value to sales comparisons  His firm has held onto the GE
shares purchased earlier this year  and is considering buying more
Schermerhorn said    The businesses they have are at least as good as
a typical industrial  and therefore we think with proper management
you re going to see earnings accelerate   Schermerhorn said  while
cautioning   It s not going to be quick",2017-11-19,Reuters
140,German growth surprise lifts Europe as China subdues Asia,"By Marc Jones LONDON  Reuters    Strong German economic growth data
drove the euro to a three week high on Tuesday and gave European
stocks a lift after five days of falls put them at a two month low
The uplift to sentiment came after disappointing Chinese industrial
and retail figures had subdued Asia  with investors also pondering
whether a marked flattening in the U S  yield curve might be a
harbinger of a more global slowdown  There was no sign of that in
German where an 0 8 percent third quarter growth reading beat
forecasts and showed the economy growing at annualized rates of more
than 3 percent  The euro jumped to  1 1696 versus the dollar on the
figures and reached a one year top against Sweden s crown after
inflation figures there came in weaker than expected   It is not the
dollar that is weak  it is the euro that is strong   said John Hardy

141,GE cutting staff ahead of new CEO s Monday overhaul  sources,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK  Reuters     General Electric  Co  N GE  is
laying off sales staff and other employees in its software division
according to people familiar with the matter  ahead of new Chief
Executive John Flannery s expected announcement on Monday of a plan to
slash costs and jettison units in an effort to improve the company s
profits  The layoffs at GE Digital  based in San Ramon  California
affect about 100 sales people in the Americas  including those who
sell GE s Predix industrial internet software  according to two
sources   The software  central to GE s strategy under former Chief
Executive Jeff Immelt  has been beset with technical problems
prompting GE to shift strategy  The 125 year old conglomerate is
considering job reductions across all of its diverse businesses  the
sources said  Struggling units such as GE Power are facing significant
staff cuts  while aviation and healthcare businesses could see lesser
reductions  the sources said  Reuters reported in August that Flannery
intended to reduce corporate staff at its Boston headquarters
significantly  a process that has begun  according to sources  The
company has also slowed construction of its headquarters  It is not
clear how many more jobs Flannery now plans to cut  or how quickly
With 295 000 employees  even a 10 percent overall reduction would
eliminate nearly 30 000 jobs  At the digital business  which has about
13 000 people including legacy information technology staff  GE is not
only cutting sales staff  It is also reducing the number of developers
who create the software  according to the two sources  speaking on
condition of anonymity  Digital sales staff were given notice in
recent days and told they could apply for about 19 remaining jobs in
the division or other jobs at GE  the sources said  GE declined to
comment on specific staff reductions  but highlighted its plan to cut
3 billion in costs by the end of 2018   Those actions include but are
not limited to  employee reductions which have been well underway for
many months   spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said  GE shares closed up
2 5 percent at  20 49   DIVIDEND CUT COMING   Analysts have slashed
estimates for GE s 2018 earnings and expect a major restructuring plan
on Monday as GE tries to pull out of a 16 year stock slump  GE is
likely to get much smaller and more focused  Jeff Sprague  an analyst
at Vertical Research Partners  wrote on Friday   It is also
conceivable that looking out a few years  GE ceases to exist as we
know it   he said  referring to a potential break up   Staffing has to
go down meaningfully   said a large Boston based fund manager who
invests in GE  The company spent billions on restructuring the last
few years but without growth in operating profit  he added  Since
becoming CEO on Aug  1  Flannery has doubled the amount of cost
cutting targeted for next year to  2 billion  and is cutting  1
billion this year  He said he has found more than  20 billion in GE
assets to sell and is looking at further changes to the portfolio
beyond that   A 30 year GE veteran  Flannery is due to present the
strategic changes and new financial targets at an investor meeting in
New York on Monday  The plans also could include cutting GE s dividend
for only the third time in GE s history  The other two were during the
Great Depression and the financial crisis  Flannery has come under
increasing pressure to boost GE s profit and share price after the
company badly missed earnings expectations for the third quarter and
lowered its financial outlook last month   GE stock has fallen more
than 36 percent this year  making it the worst performer in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average and posing the risk that the only remaining
original company in the widely watched stock index could be kicked out

142,In Beijing  Trump presses China on North Korea and trade,"By Steve Holland and Christian Shepherd BEIJING  Reuters    U S
President Donald Trump pressed China to do more to rein in North Korea
on Thursday and said bilateral trade had been unfair to the United
States  but praised President Xi Jinping s pledge that China would be
more open to foreign firms  On North Korea s nuclear and missile
programs  Trump said  China can fix this problem quickly and easily
urging Beijing to cut financial links with North Korea and also
calling on Russia to help  Trump was speaking alongside Xi in the
Chinese capital to announce the signing of about  250 billion in
commercial deals between U S  and Chinese firms  a display that some
in the U S  business community worry detracts from tackling deep
seated complaints about market access in China  Xi said the Chinese
economy would become increasingly open and transparent to foreign
firms  including those from the United States  and welcomed U S
companies to participate in his ambitious  Belt and Road
infrastructure led initiative  Trump made clear that he blamed his
predecessors  not China  for the trade imbalance  and repeatedly
praised Xi  calling him  a very special man    But we will make it
fair and it will be tremendous for both of us   Trump said  Xi smiled
widely when Trump said he does not blame China for the deficit and
also when Trump said Xi gets things done   Of course there are some
frictions  but on the basis of win win cooperation and fair
competition  we hope we can solve all these issues in a frank and
consultative way   Xi said   Keeping opening up is our long term
strategy  We will never narrow or close our doors  We will further
widen them   he said  China would also offer a more fair and
transparent environment for foreign firms  including U S  ones  Xi
said  MODEST PROGRESS Trump is pressing China to tighten the screws
further on North Korea and its development of nuclear weapons in
defiance of U N  sanctions  At least modest progress is hoped for
although there are no immediate signs of a major breakthrough  a U S
official said earlier  Referring to Xi  Trump said   I do believe
there s a solution to that  as do you   Xi reiterated that China would
strive for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula but offered no
hint that China would change tack on North Korea  with which it fought
side by side in the 1950 53 Korean war against U S  led forces   We
are devoted to reaching a resolution to the Korean peninsula issue
through dialogue and consultations   Xi said  Briefing reporters after
the talks  U S  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump told Xi
You re a strong man  I m sure you can solve this for me   Tillerson
said both leaders agreed they could not accept a nuclear armed North
Korea but he acknowledged they had some differences over tactics and
timing  Tillerson pointed out that Trump  in a speech in Seoul  had
invited the North Koreans to come to the table   in line with the
Chinese desire for a negotiated solution  He added  however  that
Trump was prepared for a  military response  if he deemed the threat
serious enough  but  that s not his first choice    We are going to
work hard on diplomatic efforts as well   he said  but did not
elaborate  In a show of the importance China puts on Trump s first
official visit  Thursday s welcoming ceremony outside Beijing s Great
Hall of the People overlooking Tiananmen Square  NYSE SQ  was
broadcast live on state television   unprecedented treatment for a
visiting leader  Earlier on Thursday  Xi said he had a deep exchange
of views with Trump and reached consensus on numerous issues of mutual
concern   For China  cooperation is the only real choice  only win win
can lead to an even better future   he said  Xi said China and the
United States strengthened high level dialogue on all fronts over the
past year and boosted coordination on major international issues  such
as the Korean peninsula and Afghanistan   Relations between China and
the United States are now on a new historical starting point   Xi said
Trump and Xi hit it off at their first meeting in April at Trump s Mar
a Lago resort in Florida and continued their  bromance  on Wednesday
with an afternoon of sightseeing together with their wives  However
divisions persist over trade and North Korea  And while Xi is riding
high after consolidating power at a twice a decade Communist Party
Congress last month  Trump comes to China saddled with low public
approval ratings and dogged by investigations into Russian links to
his election campaign   HORRIBLE  TRADE SURPLUS Trump has ratcheted up
his criticism of China s massive trade surplus with the United States
calling it  embarrassing  and  horrible  last week   and has accused
Beijing of unfair trade practices  For its part  China says U S
restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States and on high
tech exports need to be addressed  Several corporate chief executives
were in Beijing as part of a delegation led by U S  Commerce Secretary
Wilbur Ross  with  General Electric   NYSE GE  and semiconductor maker
Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc among those announcing billions of dollars
in sales to China   L3N1NF2IA  But Qualcomm s agreement to sell  12
billion worth of components to three Chinese mobile phone makers over
three years is non binding  and critics say such public announcements
are sometimes more show than substance   This shows that we have a
strong  vibrant bilateral economic relationship  and yet we still need
to focus on leveling the playing field because U S  companies continue
to be disadvantaged doing business in China   said William Zarit
chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China  Trump railed
against China s trade practices during the 2016 U S  presidential
campaign and threatened to take action once in office  But he has
since held back on any major trade penalties  making clear he was
doing so to give Beijing time to make progress reining in North Korea
A U S  official said both sides were  in sync  about wanting to
minimize friction during the visit and recreate the positive tone of
the April summit  Trump was not expected to put much emphasis in his
talks with Xi on thorny issues such as the disputed South China Sea
and self ruled Taiwan  claimed by China as its own  although the
leaders  aides may deal with those matters privately  the official
told Reuters  speaking on condition of anonymity  China has repeatedly
pushed back at suggestions it should be doing more to rein in North
Korea  which does about 90 percent of its trade with China  saying it
is fully enforcing U N  sanctions and that everyone has a
responsibility to lower tension and get talks back on track    This

143,Shareholder sues GE after  unacceptable  results hurt stock,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK  Reuters    Two weeks after  General
Electric  Co s  N GE  new chief executive vowed to shed  20 billion of
assets  a shareholder has sued the company for failing to divulge its
problems sooner and posting quarterly results that were  unacceptable
to say the least   In a proposed class action lawsuit filed Wednesday
night in the U S  District Court in Manhattan  Jihad Hachem accused GE
of securities fraud for concealing how falling demand  excess
inventory and higher costs would cause it fall far short of its 2017
profit forecast  and led to an inflated stock price  GE s market value
slid  11 billion in the two trading days after the Boston based
company on Oct  20 reported a third quarter profit of 29 cents per
share  below the 49 cents expected by analysts  and cut its 2017
profit forecast by one third  Several analysts shortly thereafter cut
their ratings or share price targets for GE  Other defendants include
Chief Executive John Flannery  his predecessor Jeffrey Immelt  and
former Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Bornstein  who left that
position this week   The complaint appears to focus on projections
conveyed during earnings calls  which by definition  were forward
looking statements   GE spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman said in an email
We intend to vigorously defend against these claims   Shareholders
have long been frustrated by GE  a maker of power plants  jet engines
medical devices and other industrial equipment and a member of the Dow
Jones Industrial Average  DJI   Through Wednesday  GE s share price
had fallen 51 percent in the 16 years since Jack Welch  who oversaw
much of its growth  passed the CEO baton to Immelt  Investors who
reinvested dividends suffered a roughly 19 percent negative total
return  In contrast  the Standard   Poor s 500  SPX  rose about 133
percent over that time period  Though Immelt had shed some units
Flannery said GE must now focus on its more promising businesses  and
hold managers accountable for poor performance  Flannery  a 30 year GE
veteran who took over on Aug  1  has made some early  symbolic cuts
including executive perks and the use of corporate jets  In his
complaint  Hachem accused the defendants of having from July 21 to Oct
20  made materially false and misleading statements about its business
in public statements and filings  and knew that doing so would mislead
investors  Hachem is represented by the law firms Glancy Prongay
Murray and Kirby McInerney and is seeking unspecified damages
Securities fraud class actions have become more plentiful in federal
courts after recent rulings in Delaware state courts dissuaded some
plaintiffs from suing there  Cornerstone Research said 226 such class
actions were filed from January to June   the most since it began
tracking filings in 1996  Most involve smaller declines in market
value and less familiar companies than GE   The case is Hachem v

147,Goldman s fledgling consumer bank draws questions from curious analysts,"By Olivia Oran  Reuters    As  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  N GS  has
unveiled more details about its strategy and financial targets to
satisfy investor demands  Wall Street s attention has turned to a
business so small and new that there may not be much to disclose  On
Tuesday  analysts questioned Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez
about Goldman s nascent consumer lending operation  which has only
begun to take shape over the past 18 months  During a conference call
to discuss third quarter results  analysts wanted to know what yields
Goldman expects from consumer lending  how creditworthy its borrowers
are  the loss rates it might incur from different kinds of loans and
how a recession would impact the operation  Larger lenders with
sprawling retail operations and long histories in consumer credit
routinely disclose such information  but Goldman Sachs is a relatively
new and small Main Street bank  It is also entering the business at a
time when consumer credit may be deteriorating  as results from rivals
JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM  and  Citigroup  Inc  N C  showed last week
Goldman s inexperience  combined with its lack of disclosure on
consumer banking  is giving some investors pause  said longtime
banking analyst Martin Mosby   Why not break out what you re actually
generating in net interest income  and growth on the balance sheet  as
a separate line item   Mosby said in an interview   Being more
explicit on the results from the balance sheet initiative would be
helpful   Goldman recently took some broad steps toward transparency
with investors  in what executives call its  under the hood
initiative  After coming under pressure due to prolonged weakness in
bond trading  once a profit engine for Goldman Sachs  the bank
outlined its first ever revenue growth target  On Tuesday  it also
introduced details on capital plans  But Goldman s consumer lending
disclosures are relatively sparse  The bank reports those results
within a unit that also includes revenue from merchant banking
private equity and other ad hoc investments  Nine analysts  including
Mosby  pressed Chavez to elaborate on loans or deposits  which were
not itemized in Goldman s 10 page earnings release  After pushing him
to share more about borrowers and loan loss expectations   Morgan
Stanley   NYSE MS  analyst Betsy Graseck said it would helpful to
provide more detail in future quarters  Autonomous Research analyst
Guy Moszkowski said he planned to follow up with further questions
Goldman launched its retail operation in April 2016 by acquiring
General Electric   NYSE GE  Co s online deposit franchise  It created
a digital loan platform called Marcus seven months later and last July
announced GS Select  which caters to higher end retail customers
Goldman s loan book now stands at  61 billion  Chavez said  It is not
clear how much of that comes from consumer lending versus other types
of borrowing  That represents less than 7 percent of Goldman s  930
billion balance sheet  By contrast  the  914 billion in loans held by
JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM   the largest U S  bank  took up 36 percent
of its  2 6 trillion balance sheet  Banks do not always offer granular
details on businesses that do not contribute meaningfully to earnings
But because lending is a pillar of Goldman s growth plans  analysts
said they are hungry to know more    When you are performing and
continuing to grow earnings and profitability is up  you can kind of
get away with  less disclosure  said Mosby   When you re being
pressured on your earnings and not performing  that forces your hand",2017-10-18,Reuters

149,Take Five  World markets themes for the week ahead,"By Marc Jones LONDON  Reuters    Following are five big themes likely
to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and
the Reuters stories related to them  1  POLITICAL EVENT STORM
Political and event risk over the coming week ranges from the possible
collapse of NAFTA talks to China s Party Congress and third quarter
Chinese growth data  Japan s general election will follow the weekend
after  Europe holds an EU summit amid deadlocked Brexit talks
Catalonia faces a deadline to clarify its fudged independence move
from Spain and Sunday s Austrian elections could give it one of the
youngest world leaders ever  The G20 meets this weekend around the
annual IMF meeting  and Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen  European
Central Bank chief Mario Draghi and Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko
Kuroda all speak  Kuroda s future at the BoJ could well be influenced
by how Prime Minister Shinzo Abe does in Japan s elections  Markets
are getting into the third quarter global earnings season as well   2
FED TIME  Speculation is swirling that U S  President Donald Trump
will announce his choice to replace Yellen at the Fed next year  The
nearly nine year rally in risk assets is based on the so called
Bernanke put   and now the Yellen put   of ultra low interest rates
and ample liquidity  So the name drawing the most scrutiny is Kevin
Warsh  a former Fed governor and avowed opponent of the  put  policies
Would that remove an important underpinning of the global rally  and
at this point  would it matter  In any case  come February  Trump may
have nominated five of the seven members of the central bank s board
of governors  including the chair and two vice chairs  3  NAFTA NO
MORE  Washington has dramatically increased tensions in talks to renew
the North American Free Trade Agreement by proposing a  sunset clause
that would force re negotiations of the  1 trillion pact every five
years  Sources have told Reuters atmosphere at the talks is  horrible
Mexico is expected to suffer the most damage if NAFTA breaks down  as
most of its exports go to the United States  Analysts expect growth to
slow and the peso to weaken  Its finance minister  Jose Antonio Meade
has said his country is analyzing tariffs and import substitution
plans in case NAFTA is scrapped  The peso  is near a five month low
Mexican stocks have lost almost 4 percent since mid August and dollar
bond prices have slipped across the curve  the 2026 issue trading at
three month lows  Canada  Mexico vow to stick with NAFTA talks  Mexico
works on Plan B U S  hikes tensions in NAFTA talks with call for
sunset clause  4  CHINA CONGRESS China is preparing for a pivotal
event  The Communist Party Congress open on Oct  18 and will see most
of the country s top officials replaced  But all eyes will be on
President Xi Jinping  who could upend decades of party tradition by
seizing more power and signal he is eyeing an unprecedented third term
Some hope a stronger Xi will put China back on liberalization path
But the fear is he will dismantle the consensus based checks and
balances put in place to prevent a return to the excesses of the Mao
era  There are also questions about the tenure of Wang Qishan  the
country s anti corruption czar  who at 69 is considered too old for
promotion  according to an unwritten rule   Investors do not expect
market volatility during the summit  regulators have already said
maintaining stability will be a priority  But expected reforms of
state run companies boosted shares in defense enterprises on Friday
and the yuan has gained around 1 percent this week   TAKE A LOOK China
gears up for 19th Communist Party Congress 5  BURNING EARNINGS  A host
of big U S  companies are due to report earnings  among them Morgan
Stanley  NYSE MS   IBM  NYSE IBM   Verizon  Procter   Gamble and
General Electric  NYSE GE   Tech heavyweights SAP and ASML will report

150,Peltz s Procter   Gamble defeat could be more humbling than harmful,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss  Reuters    Nelson Peltz put his activist hedge
fund credentials on the line to win a board seat at Procter   Gamble
Co  only to be narrowly defeated  according to a preliminary
shareholder vote count  Yet he stands to lose more face than he does
money  Peltz  CEO of Trian Fund Management  was also rebuffed in a
battle for board seats  or proxy contest  at DuPont  NYSE DWDP  two
years ago  But he went on to attract more money from investors and
have a key ally installed as the chemical maker s new chief executive
Trian said on Tuesday that the shareholder vote at P G  the biggest
company to ever face a proxy contest  was too close to call  and that
it would wait for the result to be certified by an independent
inspector  P G says Peltz has lost  But if Peltz s defeat is confirmed
there is little evidence it would cost him with his investors
industry analysts and academics said   Overall  Nelson Peltz has a
good record and he does work hard to improve companies   said
University of Michigan professor Erik Gordon   He will have no trouble
finding companies where improvements need to be made and where he ll
be let in the door   Trian s assets under management are at an all
time high of  14 billion  the result of long standing confidence by
pension funds and endowments in Trian s 12 year investment history
There was no sign on Tuesday of significant redemptions by Trian
investors   Indeed  Trian got a boost this week from another big U S
conglomerate  when General Electric  NYSE GE  Co offered a board seat
to Trian chief investment officer Ed Garden  without any proxy contest
To be sure  Trian was eager for a win at P G  Trian s 2 1 percent
return through the end of September trails the average activist hedge
fund s 4 8 percent gain this year  And it lags last year s 11 percent
return   Trian prefers to work behind the scenes and has only waged
three proxy contests since its founding in 2005  It now looks to have
lost two of them  and joins a small club of activist hedge funds that
have experienced such defeat  They include Bill Ackman s Pershing
Square  NYSE SQ  Capital Management  Barry Rosenstein s Jana Partners
and Jeff Smith s Starboard Value   In the investment community  75
year old Peltz  who speaks in calm tones and steers clear of the name
calling often heard in other contests  was thought to be the only
activist who could take on P G and its entrenched management  However
the 180 year old company  which makes Tide detergent  Crest toothpaste
and Gillette razors  always presented a challenging target for Peltz
because an unusually high 40 percent of P G s stock is held by

151,GE stock hits 4 year low as analysts debate possibility of dividend cut,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK  Reuters    Concern among investors that
General Electric Co  N GE  may not generate enough cash this year to
fully cover its dividend and other promised spending sent its stock to
its lowest level in more than four years on Wednesday   The shares
fell 1 2 percent to  23 07 after JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  said a dividend
cut was  increasingly likely  and lowered its price target on the
stock to  20 from  22   Despite the recent CEO change  by the numbers
we see a core operating performance that is below  GE s  plan
JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note on Wednesday  referring
to GE s full year forecast  Tusa was not available to comment beyond
the note   Chief Executive John Flannery  who took over the position
on August 1  is doing a comprehensive review of the company and is due
to set new targets for earnings and capital allocation  which includes
dividends  on Nov  13  GE has affirmed its commitment to the dividend
which gives GE stock the second highest dividend yield in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average and ranks it 30th among the S P 500
Dividends remain a top priority   GE spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson
said on Wednesday  declining to answer further questions as the
company is in a quiet period ahead of its third quarter results due
next week  The dividend due to be paid Oct  25 is not subject to being
cut  GE s stock has fallen 5 4 percent since Friday  including falling
1 24 percent to  23 07 on Wednesday  its lowest close since Sept  3
2013  The stock is down 27 percent this year  the worst Dow performer
On Friday GE said that its long time Chief Financial Officer Jeff
Bornstein would retire and be replaced by Jamie Miller  who has been
the head of its transportation unit  A Reuters analysis of a GE
presentation released in July and executives  comments showed that GE
could generate  6 billion less cash this year than it planned to spend
on dividends  share buybacks and other items  Its plan called for
spending up to  25 8 billion  including about  8 billion on dividends
while generating about  20 billion in cash from operations and asset
sales  GE has the capacity to pay the dividend  The company has more
than  14 billion in cash on its balance sheet and  327 billion in
orders for power plants  jet engines  locomotives  oil and gas
equipment and healthcare devices      It could trim other spending
instead  such as buying back fewer shares than the  11 billion to  13
billion it has targeted for this year   The 125 year old company has
cut its dividend six times in the last 34 years  including a 68
percent cut in 2009 during the financial crisis  It is operating
against a far more favorable economic backdrop now    A dividend cut
could crush the stock as retail investors flee  but maintaining it
gives GE little or no excess cash to grow   Jeffrey Sprague  an
analyst at Vertical Research Partners  said in a note after the
Bornstein announcement on Friday    GE has continued to shrink the
company but it has not proportionally shrunk the dividend    Some
analysts saw a dividend cut as unlikely    Cutting the dividend would
be a last resort   Moody s Investors Service credit analyst Rene
Lipsch told Reuters on Wednesday  But  he said  GE s options would
narrow next year when it no longer receives billions from asset sales
at GE Capital    Long term  he said  the dividend  depends on Flannery
s ability to increase cash flow from the businesses",2017-10-11,Reuters
152,Cyclical sector rally banks on global economic expansion,"By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  stock sectors that are
particularly dependent on economic growth recently grabbed hold of the
market s rally and are poised to keep the reins should further signs
of global expansion emerge  Such sectors  including energy
industrials and financials  beat the S P 500 s 1 9 percent gain in
September  Those sectors had previously lagged behind the benchmark S
P  SPX   which has climbed 14 percent this year while feasting on a
steady diet of record highs  Instead  shares of technology and
healthcare companies  whose profits are more impervious to economic
down cycles  have led 2017 s rally  The question for equity investors
is now  Was September just a catch up period for the lagging  cyclical
sectors  or can an economic lift support a sustained run   If it s
just a mean reversion trade  then it s probably going to last another
few weeks and then we re back to the old winners   said Walter Todd
chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood
South Carolina   If it s something more fundamental  it should be
longer lasting than that   A test comes next week  as third quarter
corporate earnings season kicks into high gear  Reports from
industrial conglomerates General Electric  N GE  and Honeywell
International  N HON   railroads CSX Corp  O CSX  and Kansas City
Southern  N KSU  and steel company Nucor Corp  N NUE  stand to yield
insight into the economy s health  September s stock action  which
also included outsized gains for small cap stocks  had echoes of the
immediate aftermath of President Donald Trump s election in November
2016   The same areas showed strength on hopes that a Republican led
federal government would push through an agenda  including tax cuts
and deregulation  that juices economic growth  Those trades faded as
Trump struggled to rack up any significant legislative wins  Now
investors say  September s stock rally for those groups again stemmed
at least in part from policy hopes  as Trump revved up his tax reform
push   In many ways  we began to replicate the market performance
following Trump s election   said Quincy Krosby  chief market
strategist at Prudential Financial  NYSE PRU  in Newark  New Jersey
But an improving economic picture in the United States and globally
lends confidence for the cyclical sector rally  The Citi economic
surprise index for the United States   a measure of economic data that
can come in weaker or stronger than forecast  is around a five month
high  with the barometer trending higher since hitting multi year lows
this summer  This week  the International Monetary Fund upgraded its
global economic growth forecast for 2017 by 0 1 percentage point to 3
6 percent  and to 3 7 percent for 2018  from its April and July
outlook  driven by a pickup in trade  investment  and consumer
confidence  The U S  Commerce Department last month revised its
estimate for second quarter gross domestic product growth to 3 1
percent  up from 3 percent   We ve just had better data   said Jim
Paulsen  chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in
Minneapolis  who also points to indicators such as firming industrial
commodity and oil prices and a rise in the Baltic Exchange s main sea
freight index  BADI    Those things are all kind of reflecting a
realism of economic momentum  not just a one off  Trump pie in the sky
expectation about policy change   Paulsen said  Bets seemed to build
on the cyclical sectors in the first week of October  which saw flows
into the largest sector exchange traded funds for financials  P XLF
industrials  P XLI  and energy  P XLE   and outflows for technology  P
XLK  and healthcare  P XLV   according to Lipper data   There is some
momentum developing in these underperforming sectors   said Anthony
Saglimbene  global market strategist at Ameriprise in Troy  Michigan
Earnings results could sway that momentum  Technology  which has
gained 29 percent this year  topping all sectors  is expected to post
a 12 2 percent increase in third quarter profits  more than twice the
expected rise for cyclical groups such as industrials and materials
Kate Warne  investment strategist at Edward Jones in St  Louis  said
global growth  hasn t been strong enough for investors to feel
comfortable that we will continue to see the earnings delivered by
those companies in the way that tech and healthcare have consistently
delivered stronger earnings     For the cyclicals to continue to
outperform  we have got to see signs that economic growth globally is
accelerating  even compared to what we have seen so far this year
Warne said",2017-10-13,Reuters
153,Kenyan debtors struggle to hold on to assets as repossessions rise,"By Duncan Miriri NAIROBI  Reuters    The Nairobi car auctioneer
hopefully scanned empty rows of rickety plastic chairs in a dusty lot
for more bids but saw only too many vehicles and not enough buyers  an
increasing problem as Kenya s economy slows and repossessions pick up
A severe drought earlier this year  a bank lending slowdown and
prolonged political uncertainty are creating a growing pool of
distressed borrowers whose assets are being seized by newly aggressive
lenders in the east African powerhouse  George Muiruri  managing
director of Leakey s auctioneers  says they are holding 10 auctions a
month  up from about four a year ago   Things are tight   Muiruri told
Reuters as he prepared to auction vehicles ranging from luxury cars to
battered workhorses once owned by painstakingly built small businesses
Because of this political environment  people are postponing so many
plans   he said  adding   You find that you repossess and then there
are no buyers   Kenya s free market credentials  staunch alliances
with Western nations and relative stability in a region roiled by
conflict has made it the richest economy in East Africa and a favored
regional headquarters for global firms like Google  NASDAQ GOOGL
IBM   NYSE IBM  and  General Electric   NYSE GE   But growth slowed to
five percent in the second quarter of this year  below the official
year s forecast of 5 5 percent  as a prolonged election season took
its toll  Kenya held presidential  parliamentary and local elections
on Aug  8  but a Supreme Court ruling on Sept  1 annulled President
Uhuru Kenyatta s re election and ordered a fresh contest  now
scheduled for Oct  26  Now even that date is in doubt  opposition
leader Raila Odinga says he will not participate unless the election
board fires officials that he blames for irregularities in August
polls   Many businesses want elections over before investing further
mindful of the weeks of post election violence that followed the
disputed 2007 presidential poll  killing around 1 200 people and
plunging the economy into a nose dive   People stopped investing in
real estate or businesses waiting to see the outcome of the election
There are delays in payments from end to end   said a bank CEO  who
did not wish to be named  SMALL BUSINESSES HIT Those delays are
choking John Wambua s small business transporting plastic water tanks
to retailers  His clients haven t paid for three months so he has been
unable to service the loan on his truck    We have had a big challenge
due to the election  The people we transport the water tanks for are
not selling and so we have no work   he said wearily at the auction
yard  where he had gone to beg for more time before his truck is
auctioned  His story is common  there is a glut of repossessed
vehicles  land  homes and office equipment being sold off cheaply
across Kenya  At Leakey s  which also operates three separate storage
yards around Nairobi  the number of vehicles stored awaiting sale
doubled to 1 500 in the past year  Muiruri said  Bank credit  formerly
easily available  has dried up after the government capped commercial
lending rates last year  leaving lenders unable to refinance seized
assets   Non performing loans in the banking industry rose to 10 7
percent in August  from 9 9 percent in June  the central bank said
jumping into double digits for the first time since 2007  Felix Apollo
chairman of the Association of Auctioneers  said banks were moving
much faster to seize property from defaulters since the cap was put
into place  There was a glut on the market of repossessed assets  he
said    The banks have become more aggressive   he said  noting one
person was killed in a fight to repossess a vehicle a couple of months
ago  But the economy retains stable macroeconomic fundamentals like
slow inflation and a stable foreign exchange rate  leading Apollo to
believe seizures will ease next year    Probably after the elections
people will go back to their normal status   he said",2017-10-03,Reuters

160,Uber picks Expedia s Dara Khosrowshahi as new CEO  sources,"By Heather Somerville  Reuters    Uber Technologies Inc  UBER UL
chose Dara Khosrowshahi  the chief executive of travel company
Expedia  Inc  NASDAQ EXPE   as its chief executive on Sunday
according to two sources with knowledge of the matter  handing him the
challenge of leading the ride services company out of a nearly year
long crisis   Khosrowshahi  48  would take on the daunting task of
mending Uber s image  repairing frayed relations among investors
rebuilding employee morale and creating a profitable business after
seven years of losses   In Khosrowshahi  Uber s board has picked an
executive with a track record of driving growth while also delivering
profits   precisely what the unprofitable Uber needs to satisfy
investors  He has also proven capable of making Expedia the leader in
another industry full of change and competition    online travel  But
he would also have to contend with the legacy of Travis Kalanick  Uber
s pugnacious co founder  who was ousted as CEO in June after
shareholders representing about 40 percent of the company s voting
power signed a letter asking him to step down amid growing concern
over his behavior and the behavior of senior managers under him  The
Uber board of directors has been meeting daily and deliberated on its
pick for CEO throughout the weekend  A spokeswoman said on Sunday that
the board had voted but was declining to disclose its choice publicly
until after informing employees  An Uber spokesman and an Expedia
spokeswoman declined to comment  Khosrowshahi did not immediately
respond to requests for comment through email and on Twitter
Khosrowshahi  who has run Expedia for 12 years  was not known to the
public to be among the top candidates for the job  He beat out Jeff
Immelt  chairman of  General Electric   NYSE GE  Co and one of the
finalists for the job  who said earlier on Sunday he was no longer in
the running  Meg Whitman  chief executive of Hewlett Packard
Enterprise  had also been a leading candidate  according to sources
close to the process  Whitman last month denied having any interest in
the job  Unlike Immelt and Whitman  Khosrowshahi is not a fixture in
the celebrity executive community  And since Expedia is based in
Bellevue  Washington  he is a Silicon Valley outsider  offering a
contrast to the  tech bro  culture Kalanick established at Uber
FOCUSED ON GROWTH The Iranian American businessman came to the United
States as a child in 1978 with his parents following the Iranian
Revolution  He received a bachelor s degree in engineering from Brown
University and got his start at investment bank Allen and Co
Khosrowshahi has certainly done well for himself   in 2015 he was the
highest paid CEO in the country  mainly because of a nearly  91
million stock option grant  He is also on the board of the New York
Times Company and sports merchandise company Fanatics Inc  Under
Khosrowshahi s leadership  Expedia more than doubled its annual
revenue since 2012 to nearly  8 8 billion in 2016  The company
reported net income of  281 8 million for 2016  In an interview with
CNBC in May  he said   Analysts are focused on margins  I am focused
on growth   He led Expedia through a string of acquisitions since 2014
buying Airbnb rival HomeAway Inc for  3 9 billion  Orbitz Worldwide
Inc for  1 3 billion and Travelocity for  280 million  cobbling
together an online travel empire  Expedia is the world s largest
online travel agency by bookings  He has been an outspoken critic of
President Donald Trump  blasting Trump s travel ban  which includes
Iran  as  inward looking  and  reactionary   Expedia filed a legal
challenge to the ban  At Uber  he would bring an end to a company
culture built on founder control  Kalanick enjoyed sweeping authority
on the board and nearly complete autonomy in running the company  a
governance style that helped to create a workplace that had few checks
and balances  Uber has been hit by allegations of sexual harassment  a
lawsuit alleging trade secrets theft  a federal criminal probe over
use of software to evade city regulators  and allegations of
executives mishandling the medical records of a victim who was raped
by her Uber driver in India  among other controversies  Uber was
valued at  68 billion at its most recent investment last year  but
recently some mutual funds have written down the value of their Uber
investment by as much as 15 percent  a sign of wavering confidence in
the company  Despite the controversies  Uber is still a growing
company  Last week  the company reported a 16 percent increase in ride
bookings and a 17 percent jump in net revenue for the second quarter
over the previous period  and its losses shrank by 9 percent  Among
Khosrowshahi s first tasks at Uber would be filling a slew of
executive vacancies  including those of chief financial officer  chief
operating officer and general counsel  In the absence of top
leadership  Uber has been run by a 13 person committee  What role
Kalanick has in the company going forward is a critical question whose
answer remains unclear  In a previous statement  Kalanick said he
would support the new CEO  to guide Uber into its next phase of growth
and ensure its continued success    A spokesman for Kalanick did not

162,Some U S  coding boot camps stumble in a crowded field,"By Salvador Rodriguez SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    The hype is fading for
coding  boot camps   for profit U S  schools offering graduates entry
into the lucrative world of software development  Closures are up in a
field now jammed with programs promising to teach students in just
weeks the skills needed to get hired as professional coders  So far
this year  at least eight schools have shut down or announced plans to
close in 2017  according to the review website Course Report  Two
pioneers in the sector  San Francisco s Dev Bootcamp and The Iron Yard
of Greenville  South Carolina  announced in July that they are being
shut down by their corporate parents  Others  including market leaders
like General Assembly  a New York firm that has raised  120 million in
venture capital  are shifting their focus to corporate training
Competition has begun to squeeze out players in a field now crowded
with nearly 100 academies in the United States and Canada  more than
double the number just three years ago  Many in the industry expect
more closures as the space begins to consolidate around dominant
schools able to produce top flight coders   Quality is going to win
out in this industry  but it s going to be turbulent for a while
said Anthony Hughes  chief executive of Tech Elevator  a coding boot
camp in Cleveland   Fed by growing demand for coders and more than
250 million in venture funding  boot camps have mushroomed in recent
years  Average tuition is just over  11 000 for a 14 week course  but
can climb as high as  24 000 for longer programs  according to Course
Report  The training is aimed mainly at professionals looking to
switch careers as well as students lacking the money or interest in
attending a four year college   Some schools have students report to
their classrooms  others offer their courses exclusively online
Students are prepared for entry level technical roles such as junior
developers building apps and websites  or as quality assurance
engineers sniffing out bugs in code   Collectively  these boot camps
expect to graduate 23 000 students this year  more than double the 10
333 students that graduated in 2015  according to Course Report  which
says starting salaries average around  69 000    For a graphic on
coding boot camps  see    UNSUSTAINABLE MODELS The first coding boot
camps began to appear in 2011  The U S  job market was still suffering
from the Great Recession while demand for software engineers was
growing  Many workers were eager to retrain for high paying technology
jobs  Dev Bootcamp  launched in 2012  was among the first to offer
intensive courses teaching web development coding languages such as
JavaScript and Ruby  The popular classes soon spawned competitors such
as Hack Reactor  Hackbright and App Academy  Investors quickly saw the
potential for expanding the concept beyond the San Francisco area to
burgeoning tech communities around the country  Venture firms
including New York based Thrive Capital put funding into New York s
Flatiron School and Codecademy  Jeff Bezos  chief executive of Amazon
com Inc  O AMZN   was an investor in General Assembly s  4 5 million
Series A and  10 million Series B funding rounds in 2011 and 2012
Coding boot camps also got the attention of Kaplan Inc  the Fort
Lauderdale  Florida  test prep and vocational education company  and
Apollo Education Group Inc  the company that operates the University
of Phoenix  Kaplan bought Dev Bootcamp in 2014 while Apollo acquired
The Iron Yard the following year  But those two schools struggled
under new ownership  Their cost structures were higher than those of
mom and pop competitors but they didn t have big bankrolls to
subsidize them like some venture backed schools  people familiar with
the situation said   Despite continued growth in enrollment  Dev
Bootcamp said in an early July statement that it could not  find a
viable business model  that could cover  the critical day to day costs
of running our campuses   The school is slated to shut down by year
end  One week later  The Iron Yard  which had offered courses in 22
cities  announced it  too  would close   In considering the current
environment  the board of The Iron Yard has made the difficult
decision to cease operations at all campuses after teaching out
remaining summer cohorts   Iron Yard said in a statement   Other boot
camp owners say their schools are thriving by delivering exactly what
was promised  Flatiron School  which has raised  14 5 million in
venture funding  boasts a job placement rate of 97 percent  with an
average full time starting salary of almost  76 000 a year  Flatiron
School s outcomes are audited by a Massachusetts accounting firm
according to the school   If you aren t putting out real outcomes
students are going to be skeptical   said Adam Enbar  chief executive
of Flatiron School  Zach Newburgh  28  a Flatiron online student from
New York  credits the school for helping him land a position as a
junior web developer at Blackrock  NYSE BLK  Inc  the New York
investment firm    I was looking for a job where I d be able to code
every day at a Fortune 500 company   said Newburgh  who said he
received multiple job offers   With Flatiron  not only did they give
me the skills necessary to be successful  they were a pipeline into
Blackrock    Other students say getting a job was much tougher than
they expected  Chase Thomas  31  a resident of Walnut Creek
California  said it took him six months to land a position after
spending  25 000 on courses with Thinkful  an online coding school
and General Assembly  where he completed a 10 week course at the
company s San Francisco location  Now a quality assurance engineer at
the software vendor Workday  Thomas said he was happy he took the
classes  But he said he would not recommend that route for everyone
especially if it involved taking on debt  like he did   Boot camps are
seen as a ticket to the middle class  Everyone can do it  but the key
is  do you want to   Thomas said   I love it  but it s not for
everybody    GOING CORPORATE Some bigger  venture backed boot camp
startups  meanwhile  are shifting their attention to the corporate
training market  Denver based Galvanize  for example  which has raised
63 million in venture capital  says it has begun helping corporate
clients such as International Business Machines Corp  N IBM  and
General Electric  Co  N GE  hire engineers and retrain their staffs
with coding skills the companies need  Corporate training has grown to
one third of its revenue  up from 10 percent  in just six months  and
could  easily  surpass the company s consumer business in the near
future  said Lawrence Mandes  co founder and chief revenue officer of
Galvanize  General Assembly serves the likes of Adobe Systems Inc  O
ADBE   AT T Inc  N T  and  Target  Corp  N TGT   Smaller players like
Hack Reactor and Hackbright Academy are also placing a greater focus
on the corporate market  But this niche has its challenges too
Boulder  Colorado based RefactorU decided in December to pivot to
running boot camps for other education providers  according to Sean
Daken  who founded the school in 2013  But he said those clients came
far more slowly than expected and a cash crunch ensued    The sale

163,No more low cost  East Europe goes up in the world,"By Jan Lopatka BRATISLAVA  Reuters    Central and Eastern Europe faces
the end of an economic era   With employment rates at record highs
and workers demanding wages closer to western levels  the cheap labor
model that has driven growth since the fall of communism is on the way
out  The challenge that faces governments and companies in the region
over the coming years is to find new avenues to growth   A walkout at
the Volkswagen factory in Bratislava last month  the first strike at a
major Slovak car plant  led to a staggered 14 percent pay hike in what
has become the latest and starkest sign of the shifting economic
landscape   VW was one of dozens of big Western manufacturers beating
a path to Slovakia  the Czech Republic  Poland and Hungary after the
fall of communism in search of cheap labor  The rush eastwards marked
the birth of an economic model that transformed the region  But a
quarter of a century down the line  the regional labor market is
running dry  with record low unemployment rates of around 3 7 percent
across the region   As a result wages are rising faster than in the
West   led by Hungary with a 12 8 percent year on year leap in March
For graphic on wages and productivity in Central and Eastern Europe
click   Zoroslav Smolinsky  the VW Slovakia union leader who
engineered the strike  had joined the production line in 1992  when
the plant had just been taken over by Germany s VW  DE VOWG p    He
was paid the equivalent of 75 euros a month at the time   We could
live on it   he said   We had to   Today Volkswagen s 12 300 workers
in Bratislava earn an average of 1 804 euros a month   Such rates
however  remain less than half the average Volkswagen pay packet in
Germany  and Smolinsky says such huge disparity can no longer be
justified    Times have changed   the 48 year old said   We re in the
EU and have to keep up with trends and gradually narrow the gap   The
strike was resolved with the wage increase phased over more than two
years  as well as a 500 euro one off bonus for each employee and an
extra day of holiday  VW is not alone in facing rising labor costs and
strife   French carmaker  Peugeot   PA PEUP  and South Korea s Kia  KS
000270  have both raised pay this year in Slovakia  while Audi and
Mercedes have faced strike threats in Hungary   The moves by the car
makers are particularly significant because the auto industry
represents the lion s share of foreign investment in Central and
Eastern Europe  Volkswagen units  for example  are the biggest
companies in Slovakia and the Czech Republic  while Slovakia has
become the world s top carmaker per capita  producing more than 1
million a year  Moscow based investment banking group Renaissance
Capital said foreign investors would not abandon existing projects in
the region  but new investments were likely to go elsewhere   Never
again is Central Europe likely to offer what it did in the 1990s   it
said in a note to investors   TURKEY  NORTH AFRICA Companies are
taking steps to improve productivity via methods like increased
automation in order to offset rising costs  say executives
policymakers and analysts  In the longer term some could go to other
countries instead in search of cheaper labor  Volkswagen signaled it
could steer clear of Slovakia for future investments if faced with
another costly showdown with workers  Another sharp rise in wages
would  threaten the stability of jobs   Lucia Kovarovic Makayova  a
spokeswoman for Volkswagen Slovakia  told Reuters   It could happen
that the group gives preference to a factory with lower personnel
costs when deciding on sourcing production of the next product
Renaissance Capital said investors in search of cheap labor would
ultimately look further south and east   When European business
confidence is high again  we think the next wave of investment
expansion will lap the shores of Turkey and the southern Mediterranean
it added  also singling out Morocco  Tunisia  Egypt and possibly
Ukraine and Iran  Filip Eisenreich  CEO of Czech ventilation and
cooling system producer Janka Engineering  a unit of India based Lloyd
Group  said his company was raising wages by 7 8 percent this year and
was  pretty much on the edge  in terms of labor costs   Further growth
in wages  without concurrent growth in productivity would not be
sustainable for us   he told Reuters  While labor productivity has
long been lower than in Western Europe   this difference has so far
been compensated for by lower wage costs  but those rise faster every
year than in western European countries   he added   Radek Spicar
vice president of the Czech Confederation of Industry  said
intensifying wage pressures were forcing firms to automate more
something his organization trains  Seminars  have been packed to the
roof   he said  SECOND CLASS EUROPEANS The issue of wage disparity is
a highly charged one that is pervading society and politics across the
region  It is at the heart of a perception among Poles  Slovaks
Czechs and Hungarians that they are seen by Western Europe as second
class Europeans  Politicians have seized on such grievances and have
taken up the call for better pay   Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico
backed the Volkswagen strikers  while in the Czech Republic the ruling
Social Democrats have erected billboards ahead of an October election
declaring  The End of Cheap Labour    However political and labor
leaders aiming to bring wages in line with the West must find
alternative paths to economic success  Crucial to this  most agree  is
to move industries up the value chain into higher margin areas  Big
manufacturers share less of their income with employees in Central and
Eastern Europe than they do in Western Europe  In the EU  wages on
average accounts for 47 5 percent of economic output  according to
Eurostat   but while that figure reaches 50 9 in Germany it drops to
just 40 4 in the Czech Republic  But workers in Central and Eastern
Europe are less financially productive  According to OECD data  an
hour of work in Germany produces 52 7 euros of German economic output
but just 19 4 euros in the Czech Republic  Part of the reason is that
many Czech firms produce lower margin components for global chains
rather than the finished products that deliver higher margins and
profits    We are not just cheaper labor economy but also a low cost
economy   said Spicar   We are also a supplier economy  part of global
production chains  with low share of final products   Policymakers are

165,Exclusive  Pakistan sees bigger LNG profile  imports to surge by 2022,"By Drazen Jorgic ISLAMABAD  Reuters    Pakistan says it could become
one of the world s top five buyers of liquefied natural gas  LNG
with Petroleum Minister Shahid Abbasi predicting imports could jump
more than fivefold as private companies build new LNG terminals
Outlining Pakistan s ambitious plans   which  if fully implemented
could shake up the global LNG market   Abbasi told Reuters that
imports could top 30 million tonnes by 2022  up from just 4 5 million
tonnes currently  Cheaper than fuel oil and cleaner burning than coal
LNG suits emerging economies seeking to bridge electricity shortfalls
and support growth on tight budgets   Within five years  I don t see
any reason why we should not be beyond 30 million tonnes  in annual
LNG imports   We will be one of the top five markets in the world
Abbasi said  That kind of jump would represent one of the fastest
growth stories in the energy industry  comparable to what China has
done in many commodities   but there are doubts whether Pakistan can
achieve its ambitions  given the complexity and cost of expansion
projects   It s always possible  but seems very difficult as they will
need much more  regasification  capacity and downstream pipeline
capacity   said Trevor Sikorski at Energy Aspects  a London based
industry market researcher   There are infrastructural issues and
financial issues    Still  it is one of the key LNG growth markets
and its demand will help tighten up the market that has threatened to
lurch into over supply   Abbasi said no one took Pakistan seriously
after a decade of botched attempts to bring LNG to the country  but
this has changed with the construction of new LNG terminals and gas
plants  He said foreign suppliers are now arriving in Pakistan   where
energy shortages have prompted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to promise
he ll end the country s frequent blackouts   Before  we used to go out
to talk to LNG suppliers  Now they re coming to us   Abbasi said
LNG  is really what has saved the whole energy system  It has been a
huge success in Pakistan and it will continue   he said after Sharif
on Friday inaugurated a new Chinese built LNG power plant that uses
General Electric   N GE  turbines  GETTING CONNECTED Pakistan built
its first LNG terminal in 2015 and  after some delays  a second
terminal is due to come online in October  doubling annual import
capacity to about 9 million tonnes  A consortium of  Exxon Mobil   N
XOM    Total   PA TOTF   Mitsubishi  T 8058   Qatar Petroleum and
Norway s Hoegh  OL HLNGH  is expected to decide by September whether
to build a third LNG terminal for about  700 million  Abbasi said
Pakistan has dropped plans to finance up to two more terminals  as
private companies have said they would finance these themselves and
use Pakistan s existing gas network to sell directly to consumers
That s been the real success and that s where the growth will come
from   Abbasi said  adding that about 10 million homes are linked to
gas connections in Pakistan   a nation of around 200 million   In the
last four years  we would have added two million additional
connections  We are really ramping that up   If Pakistan achieves its
ambitious development goals  it could significantly erode market
oversupply  which has helped pull down Asian LNG spot prices by more
than 70 percent since 2014 to around  5 per million British thermal
units  mmBtu   Abbasi said Pakistan is in talks with Russia  Indonesia
Malaysia and Oman about government to government deals for up to three
monthly LNG cargoes for its second terminal  which can import 600
million cubic feet of gas per day  equal to six cargoes a month   We
have a basic idea of what the market is  So if we are able to better
those prices through negotiated procurement  we will go with that
otherwise we might float some more tenders   Abbasi said  Tenders for
two of the terminal s six cargoes have already been won by trading
house Gunvor and Italy s Eni  MI ENI   which have signed 5 year and 15
year deals  respectively  The contracts are worth about  5 billion
over their lifetime  Qatar supplies most of the gas for Pakistan s
first LNG terminal  Abbasi said Pakistan is considering inviting
private investors to build small scale gas power plants to add another
3 000 4 000 megawatts to the network  on top of the three new LNG
plants that will contribute 3 600 MW",2017-07-10,Reuters

Commission said on Thursday that it had sent three separate charge
sheets known as statements of objections to General Electric  Merck
KGaA and Canon after investigations showed breaches of the bloc s
merger rules  While the charges will not affect the EU approvals of
the deals  they could lead to fines of up to 1 percent of global

167,America s hungriest wind and solar power users  big companies,"By Nichola Groom LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Major U S  corporations such
as Wal Mart Stores Inc  N WMT  and General Motors Co  N GM  have
become some of America s biggest buyers of renewable energy  driving
growth in an industry seen as key to helping the United States cut
carbon emissions  Last year nearly 40 percent of U S  wind contracts
were signed by corporate power users  along with university and
military customers  That s up from just 5 percent in 2013  according
to the American Wind Energy Association trade group  These users also
accounted for an unprecedented 10  of the market for large scale solar
projects in 2016  figures from research firm GTM Research show  Just
two years earlier there were none   The big reason  lower energy bills
GRAPHIC   Big companies are powering the U S  clean energy push
Costs for solar and wind are plunging thanks to technological advances
and increased global production of panels and turbines  Coupled with
tax breaks and other incentives  big energy users such as GM are
finding renewables to be competitive with  and often cheaper than
conventional sources of electricity  The automaker has struck deals
with two Texas wind farms that will soon provide enough energy to
power over a dozen GM facilities  including the U S  sport utility
vehicle assembly plant in Arlington  Texas that produces the Chevrolet
Tahoe  Cadillac Escalade and GMC Yukon   The company is already saving
5 million a year worldwide  according to Rob Threlkeld  GM s global
manager of renewable energy  and has committed to obtaining 100  of
its power from clean sources by 2050    It s been primarily all driven
off economics   Threlkeld said   Wind and solar costs are coming down
so fast that it made it feasible    For a graphic showing the
corporate green energy rush  see     Growing corporate demand for
green energy comes as U S  President Donald Trump is championing
fossil fuels and targeting environmental regulations as job killers
This month he announced the United States will withdraw from the
landmark Paris Agreement to fight climate change  a move that was
condemned by several prominent U S  executives  including  General
Electric   NYSE GE  Co Chief Executive Jeff Immelt  Trump s
administration  however  has made no moves to target federal tax
incentives for renewable energy projects  thanks mainly to bipartisan
support in Congress  Many Republican lawmakers hail from states that
are major solar or wind energy producers  among them Texas  Oklahoma
and Iowa  U S  companies  meanwhile  are pursuing their own clean
energy agendas independent of Washington politics  Over the past four
years  corporations have contracted for about 7 gigawatts of renewable
energy   enough to power more than 1 million homes  That number is
expected to rise to 60 GW by 2025  according to the Edison Foundation
Institute for Electric Innovation  a utility backed non profit based
in Washington D C  Growth in renewables for years was driven by
utilities laboring to meet tough state mandates to reduce carbon
emissions  particularly in places such as California  Early corporate
adopters included Alphabet Inc  O GOOGL  and Amazon com Inc  O AMZN
leading edge companies with progressive company cultures  deep pockets
and major power needs  Now mainstream industries are stepping in as
costs have plummeted  Wind power costs have dropped 66  since 2009
according to the American Wind Energy Association  while the cost to
install solar has declined 70  since 2010  according to the Solar
Energy Industries Association trade group   This year alone  home
improvement retailer  Home Depot  Inc  N HD   wireless provider T
Mobile US Inc  O TMUS   banker Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and food
producer  General Mills   N GIS  announced major purchases of
renewable energy  POWER TO THE PPA Such deals can take many forms  but
most are so called power purchase agreements  Known as PPAs  these are
roughly 10 to 20 year contracts in which the owner of a large solar or
wind project sells electricity to large customers  often at rates
lower than those charged by utilities  These agreements allow energy
users to buy renewables at attractive prices with no upfront
investment  These agreements also help companies avoid outages if the
sun doesn t shine or the wind doesn t blow  The massive wind farms and
solar plants that support these contracts often supply electricity
straight to the grid rather than feed it directly to corporate
customers  plants and offices  Companies get the benefit of clean
energy without cutting themselves off from the security of the grid
The arrangement also saves companies from having to do it all
themselves  Mark Vanderhelm  vice president of energy for Wal Mart
said the retailer is about half way to its goal of sourcing 50  of its
power from renewable sources by 2025  While the chain has installed
solar panels atop hundreds of stores  it has purchased much of its
green energy via two PPAs   For us to meet our goals  we wouldn t be
able to get there by doing it all on site  We just fundamentally don t
have enough roof space   Vanderhelm said  He said Wal Mart is seeing
roughly single digit percentage savings with its green power contracts
Furniture retailer IKEA is a notable exception to the PPA trend
preferring to own the renewable energy assets that serve its U S
business  including rooftop solar systems on most of its buildings and
two wind farms in Texas and Illinois  The approach is part of the
Swedish company s long term corporate strategy of owning all of its
stores  factories and the land on which they re built  Demand from big
corporations has benefited a host of wind and solar developers
including Pattern Energy  O PEGI   First Solar  O FSLR  and NextEra
Energy  N NEE   BNB Renewable Energy Holdings LLC  a privately held
New York based developer  said corporations now make up about half its
business    There is a convergence right now where price is low and
their sustainability commitments are high   said Jos Nicholas  a
managing partner with BNB  The developers or owners of the projects
meanwhile  get the stability of long term contracts plus those federal
tax breaks  The solar credit is worth up to 30 percent of a project s
value  For wind  the most popular tax credit is a maximum of 2 4 cents
per kilowatt hour of electricity produced for a decade   AMBITIOUS
GOALS Since 2014  nearly 100 large global companies have committed to
transitioning to 100  renewables through a partnership with The
Climate Group  a nonprofit that s working to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions  Roughly two corporations a month are joining that effort
according to Amy Davidsen  the organization s executive director for
North America  In addition to GM  U S  companies that have made the
commitment include Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ   Procter   Gamble Co  N
PG  and  Nike  Inc  N NKE   Still  many big firms remain on the
sidelines because they lack an overall corporate sustainability
mandate  view renewables as having unattractive returns or because the
contracts are too long  according to a 2016 PricewaterhouseCoopers
survey  Many small  and medium sized businesses have a hard time
benefiting too  They don t consume enough energy to negotiate large
lowest cost PPAs like the big guys  Smaller projects  such as
installing rooftop solar panels  tend to depend heavily on state and
local incentives that come and go   The 2020 expiration of the federal
tax incentives is another concern  But industry watchers expect U S
companies will continue their ambitious public commitments to boost
renewable energy use even if those breaks aren t renewed  General
Mills  for instance  sees climate change as a major threat to the
agricultural supply chain behind products such as Cheerios cereal and
Yoplait yogurt  The company has a goal of reducing its greenhouse gas
emissions by 28 percent by 2025    If the front end of that business
model breaks down    Mother Nature    we re in a world of hurt   Lynch

169,In Pakistan  China presses built in advantage for  Silk Road  contracts,"By Drazen Jorgic ISLAMABAD  Reuters    Last year  Pakistan held
informal talks with  General Electric   NYSE GE   Siemens and
Switzerland s ABB to build the country s first high voltage
transmission line  Chinese power giant State Grid committed to
building the  1 7 billion project in half the time of its European
counterparts   and clinched the deal  This is a familiar tale in
Pakistan and many other countries  As China makes its  Belt and Road
initiative   a massive project to connect Asia with Africa and Europe
through land and maritime routes   a policy priority for the next
decade  Chinese companies are taking the lion s share of
infrastructure projects across the region  Just last year  Chinese
firms won project contracts in Belt and Road countries worth  126
billion  state media reported   In Pakistan  whose geographical
position makes it central to Beijing s  Silk Road  plans  contracts
have been awarded for projects worth more than  28 billion   all by
Chinese companies working together with local firms  More than  20
billion in new investment is likely in the next few years  Pakistan s
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal told Reuters this week   Last month
Pakistan s government took out full page newspaper advertisements on
the first China Pakistan project completed under the plan  a 1 300 mw
coal plant that it said was constructed in 22 months  a record time
for such a facility  The plant is owned by China s state owned Huaneng
Shandong and the Shandong Ruyi Science   Technology Group  China Inc s
main advantage  officials in both countries said  is the ability of
Chinese banks   with the blessing of the government   to fast track
loans for projects related to the Silk Road  That makes a huge
difference to projects like Pakistan s power transmission line  which
aims to end regular energy cuts that leave the country s 190 million
population without electricity for several hours every day    Chinese
companies have  that advantage because of the support of the Chinese
government   said Mohammad Younus Dagha  a senior government official
who was in charge at the Water and Power Ministry until earlier this
year  Dagha  who spoke to Reuters shortly before being transferred to
the Commerce Ministry  said Beijing was fast tracking loan approvals
and pushing its banks and insurance firms to speed up due diligence
work  Chinese government officials declined comment on specific loan
approvals  FAVOR LENDING But two officials at two Chinese state owned
banks that direct government funding  China Development Bank  CDB  and
Export Import Bank of China  EXIM   told Reuters that they have been
instructed by the government to favor lending to Chinese firms for
Silk Road projects  The officials also said that the two banks prefer
that companies working on infrastructure projects across the region
import raw materials or purchase equipment from China   There is some
criticism in Pakistan that the awarding of the contracts to Chinese
companies   while speeding up projects   is also costing the country
more money  In the transmission line project deal  for example
General Electric estimated it could make one key part of the line
the converter stations   for about 25 percent less than what State
Grid was charging  according to a Pakistani government official and
two power sources familiar with GE s projections  By awarding the
contract to State Grid  Islamabad paid a higher price  they said  An
official at Nepra  Pakistan s independent energy regulator  said State
Grid was also given a tax break not on offer to other investors
Pakistani government officials declined to comment on tax issues
regarding the deal   China Electric Power Technologies Company Limited
CET   the State Grid subsidiary that will build the line  said the
price it asked for was fair   It s a very reasonable cost   said Fiaz
Ahmad Chaudhry  managing director of Pakistan s National Transmission
Despatch Company  NTDC  referring to the overall State Grid contract
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the process for
Belt and Road projects in Pakistan was  open and transparent  and
would bolster bilateral relations and regional prosperity  The edge of
Chinese companies in Pakistan is likely to continue  Under the Silk
Road plan  China and Pakistan are planning to build  57 billion worth
of power plants  port facilities  railway lines and roads in Pakistan
During a meeting in Bejing last month  Chinese President Xi Jinping
said that the plan would be accelerated  POWER LINES The transmission
line project was conceived as a government to government contract to
build a 878 km  545 mile  connection between soon to built power
plants near the coastal town of Matiari and Pakistan s industrial
heartland by the eastern city of Lahore  According to Pakistani
officials  no formal competitive bidding was sought for the project
which was finally awarded in December last year  But the officials
said GE  Siemens and ABB were contacted when initial talks with State
Grid stalled around mid 2016 over costs  Dagha told Reuters he briefly
met officials from the three companies on the sidelines of a Paris
power conference in August and informally talked about the
transmission line contract with them   GE made an initial cost
estimate of  800 million for the converter stations  against State
Grid s initial bid of  1 26 billion  according to documents from Nepra
and sources familiar with GE s cost estimate  Despite the lower cost
the problem for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif s government was speed
Sharif has staked his political credibility on ending Pakistan s
frequent power blackouts before the next general election are held by
August 2018   So  Dagha said he asked the Western companies to also
match State Grid s ambitious timeline and wrap up work in 27 months
They said  you must be joking   it s impossible    Dagha recalled
Dagha said Western executives predicted it would take at least 48
months to build the line   They said just to prepare the proposal
and for the banks to agree to that would require at least 8 9 months
at the fastest pace    One Western energy company executive in Europe
confirmed the meeting took place  Another executive in Europe who is
familiar with the matter said  international companies did not have
the opportunity to make a bid for the project   Both sources declined
to be named   General Electric  Siemens and ABB declined to comment  A
QUESTION OF TIME There was domestic pressure in Pakistan to speed up
the deal  several government and regulatory officials said  An
official at Nepra  which had to sign off on the contract  said the
government put pressure on the regulator to accept State Grid s price
demands  warning the deal could come apart as the Chinese were
prepared to walk away   Pakistan s government did not respond to
claims Nepra was put under pressure  although government officials
have in the past voiced frustrations that the regulatory agency was
slowing down projects   The Nepra official also said the Pakistani
government had sweetened the deal for State Grid by removing a 7 5
percent withholding tax on tariffs the Chinese company would charge
consumers the next 25 years  The tax break  the Nepra official said
was not on offer for other companies  Federal government officials and
the NTDC did not respond to requests for comment on the removal of the
withholding tax  State Grid was awarded the contract in December last
year  It charged  1 7 billion  including a trimmed  1 billion for the
converter stations  according to public documents seen by Reuters
Khawaja Asif  Pakistan s energy minister  defended charges that
Pakistan was favoring the Chinese or overpaying for power
infrastructure   That conclusion is a bit misplaced  or exaggerated
said Asif  Ashfaq Mahmood  a former top bureaucrat in Pakistan s Water

172,GE s new CEO to review portfolio  with no constraint ,"By Alwyn Scott and Arunima Banerjee  Reuters     General Electric
NYSE GE  Co s incoming chief executive said on Monday he will conduct
a swift review of the business portfolio  and signaled its strategy of
selling software related services across its many divisions will
remain the heart of GE for decades  The maker of jet engines  power
plants  medical scanners and railroad locomotives on Monday named
veteran insider John Flannery as its next chief executive  He takes
over from Jeff Immelt who will step aside Aug  1 after 16 years as the
head of the conglomerate he helped steer through the financial crisis
but is now worth a third less than when he took over    I m going to
do a fast but deliberate  methodical review of the whole company
Flannery said in an interview with Reuters   The board has encouraged
me to come in and look at it afresh   On a separate call with
investors earlier  Flannery said  we ll review each of those
businesses in the portfolio  how it benefits and contributes to the
broader company  And it s something you can expect us to do with speed
and with urgency and with no constraint   Although not detailing
specific plans  Flannery did say digital will be at the heart of GE s
strategy  GE has spent billions building a digital business that
marries electronic sensors and powerful analytic computing to
industrial equipment and has no plans to change that focus   Digital
is going to be a core aspect of the company for the next generation
Flannery said  GE will make the results of the review public in the
fall  but major changes are not needed  Flannery said   We re not
starting from a weak position at all   Immelt  in the interview  said
Flannery has a free hand to do what he wants   There s nobody more
open to him driving change than me   GE will press ahead with cutting
overhead costs by  2 billion by 2019 and boosting profits to  2 a
share next year  Flannery  a 55 year old who joined the company 30
years ago and is now the head of its healthcare unit  will also become
chairman after Immelt retires on Dec  31  The company s shares were up
3 8 percent at  29 as Flannery s appointment ended six years of
succession planning  Immelt  61  who took over from Jack Welch in 2001
oversaw the divestment of its massive lending unit GE Capital and TV
network NBCUniversal  shifting the conglomerate s focus away from
finance and toward technology  healthcare and manufacturing   Despite
investing heavily on developing digital products  from sensors in jet
engines to augmented reality software  shareholders have been wary of
the company s new direction  Since Immelt became CEO in 2001  GE s
shares have declined 30 percent  while the S P 500 index more than
doubled  That underperformance had some pressing for more urgency from
Immelt  Activist investor Nelson Peltz s Trian Fund Management bought
a stake in GE in October 2015  the largest single investment the firm
had ever made  and now worth about  2 billion  Trian immediately
pushed for asset sales and cost cuts  Trian declined comment on the
CEO change on Monday  GE said Immelt s departure was not triggered by
outside influences  and that its board set the summer of 2017 for
Immelt s departure as far back as 2013  Stifel analyst Robert McCarthy
said the timing was not surprising because of the serial
underperformance of the stock and  investor fatigue with management s
continued perceived ungainly portfolio actions   During Immelt s
tenure  GE bought French peer Alstom s power business and announced a
deal to acquire oil and gas company Baker Hughes  while jettisoning
the NBC unit and even its famed appliances division  Still  the
company   the oldest surviving member of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average   has struggled to boost sales significantly in the past few
quarters  In particular  the company s cash flow has been a cause for
concern  Flannery  who joined GE Capital in 1987  focused on leveraged
buyouts and later led the corporate restructuring group  He has also
ran GE s India business  its equity business in Latin America and the
GE Capital business for Argentina and Chile  Flannery has helped turn
around GE s healthcare business  increasing organic revenue by 5
percent and margins by 100 basis points in 2016  GE said in a
statement   The company said Kieran Murphy  president and CEO of GE
Healthcare Life Sciences  will replace Flannery",2017-06-12,Reuters
173,Vietnam to sign deals for up to  17 billion in U S  goods  services  prime minister,"By David Lawder and David Brunnstrom WASHINGTON  Reuters    Vietnamese
Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said on Tuesday he would sign deals
for U S  goods and services worth  15 billion to  17 billion during
his visit to Washington  D C   mainly for high technology products and
for services   Vietnam will increase the import of high technologies
and services from the United States  and on the occasion of this visit
many important deals will be made   Phuc told a U S  Chamber of
Commerce dinner  Phuc  who is due to meet with U S  President Donald
Trump on Wednesday at the end of a three day visit to the United
States  did not provide any further details of the transactions   GE
Power Chief Executive Officer Steve Bolze told the dinner that
General Electric  Co  N GE  will sign new business worth about  6
billion with Vietnam  but also offered no details  Phuc s comments
came after U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expressed
concern about the rapid growth of the U S  trade deficit with Vietnam
saying this was a new challenge for the two countries and he was
looking to Phuc to help address it   Over the last decade  our
bilateral trade deficit has risen from about  7 billion to nearly  32
billion   Lighthizer said   This concerning growth in our trade
deficit presents new challenges and shows us that there is
considerable potential to improve further our important trade
relationship   Lighthizer and other Trump administration trade
officials have pledged to work to reduce U S  bilateral trade deficits
with major trading partners  The  32 billion deficit with Vietnam last
year    the sixth largest U S  trade deficit    reflects growing
imports of Vietnamese semiconductors and other electronics products in
addition to more traditional sectors such as footwear  apparel and
furniture  The trade issue has become a potential irritant in a
relationship where Washington and Hanoi have stepped up security
cooperation in recent years given shared concerns about China s
increasingly assertive behavior in East Asia  In a meeting on Tuesday
Trade Minister Tran Tuan Anh told Lighthizer about Vietnam s views and
solutions to some U S  concerns  such as advertising on U S  social
media  electronic payment services and imports of information security
and farm products  the southeast Asian nation s trade ministry said
Vietnam also urged the United States to remove an inspection program
on catfish  speed import licenses for its fruit and make fair
decisions on anti dumping and anti subsidy measures on Vietnamese
products  the ministry said in a statement  Phuc s meeting with Trump
makes him the first southeast Asian leader to visit the White House
under the new administration  It reflected calls  letters  diplomatic
contacts and lower level visits that started long before Trump took
office in Washington  where Vietnam retains a lobbyist at  30 000 a
month   Vietnam was disappointed when Trump ditched the 12 nation
Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP  trade pact  in which Hanoi was
expected to be one of the main beneficiaries  and focused U S  trade
policy on reducing deficits",2017-05-31,Reuters
174,Trump hails deals worth  billions  with Vietnam,"By Roberta Rampton and David Brunnstrom WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S
President Donald Trump talked trade with Vietnamese Prime Minister
Nguyen Xuan Phuc during a White House visit on Wednesday and welcomed
the signing of business deals worth billions of dollars and the jobs
they would create  The U S  Commerce Department announced 13 new
transactions with Vietnam worth  8 billion  including  3 billion worth
of U S  produced content that would support more than 23 000 American
jobs  These include deals for  General Electric  Co  N GE  worth  5 58
billion for power generation  aircraft engines and services  its
largest ever combined sale in Vietnam   Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT  and
its dealer in Vietnam also agreed to provide generator management
technology for more than 100 generators in Vietnam  the company said
They  Vietnam  just made a very large order in the United States   and
we appreciate that   for many billions of dollars  which means jobs
for the United States and great  great equipment for Vietnam   Trump
told reporters at the White House  The Commerce Department estimate of
the deals was considerably less than the  15 billion figure given by
Phuc during a speech at the Heritage Foundation  adding that most of
the total involved the import of U S  equipment  Communist Vietnam has
gone from being a Cold War enemy to an important partner for the
United States in the Asia Pacific  where both countries share concerns
about China s rising power  Phuc told Trump the relationship had
undergone  significant upheavals in history  but that the two
countries were now  comprehensive partners   Phuc s meeting with Trump
makes him the first Southeast Asian leader to visit the White House
under the new administration  TRADE FRICTION However  while Hanoi and
Washington have stepped up security cooperation in recent years  trade
has become a potential irritant  with a deficit widening steadily in
Vietnam s favor  reaching  32 billion last year  compared with  7
billion a decade earlier  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said it was
important to shrink the U S  trade deficit with Vietnam but noted that
the southeast Asian country of 80 million people was the fastest
growing market for U S  exports  rising 77 percent since 2014 to  4 4
billion   The growth of the middle class and the increasing purchasing
power in Vietnam are further incentives to strengthening our long term
trade and investment relationship   Ross said  Trump  who has had
strong words for countries with large trade surpluses with the United
States  said he would be discussing trade with Phuc  as well as North
Korea   Washington has been seeking support to pressure North Korea to
drop its nuclear and missile programs  which have become an increasing
threat to the United States  Hanoi has said it shares concerns about
North Korea  In his Heritage speech  Phuc welcomed Trump s plans to
attend the November APEC summit in Hanoi  He called it a sign of U S
commitment to the region and  an important occasion for the United
States to assert its positive role   In a reference to somewhat warmer
ties between Washington and Beijing under Trump  who has been courting
China s support on North Korea  Phuc said Vietnam welcomed good
relations between the two powers  but hoped these would serve the
interest of other nations in the region too  He urged Washington and
Beijing  to act with full transparency and in a responsible manner so
as not to impact negatively the region and relations among other
nations   Vietnam s government said on its website Trump and Phuc had
agreed to promote defense ties and discussed the possibility of U S
vessels  including aircraft carriers  visiting Vietnamese ports  It
said they had expressed concern about the South China Sea  where
Vietnam  Malaysia  the Philippines and Brunei are involved in maritime
disputes with China  which claims nearly all the strategic waterway
Taiwan also stakes a claim   They emphasized that parties must not
take actions accelerating tension such as the militarization of
disputed structures   it said  an apparent reference to China s
construction work   NICE  BUT NOT ENOUGH   Murray Hiebert  a Southeast
Asia expert at Washington s Center for Strategic and International
Studies  said that while the Trump administration welcomed new
business deals with Vietnam  its view was they were  nice  but not
enough    They want Vietnam to bring some ideas about how to tackle
the surplus on an ongoing basis   he said   On Tuesday  U S  Trade
Representative Robert Lighthizer expressed concern about the rapid
growth of the deficit with Vietnam  He said it was a new challenge for
the two countries and he was looking to Phuc to help address it  The
deficit is Washington s sixth largest and reflects growing imports of

175,Trump to reassure Saudi allies  promote business  talk tough on radicalism,"By Yara Bayoumy and Katie Paul WASHINGTON RIYADH  Reuters    When U S
President Donald Trump meets Saudi princes in Riyadh on Saturday  he
can expect a warmer welcome than the one given a year ago to his
predecessor Barack Obama  who Riyadh considered soft on arch foe Iran
and cool toward a bilateral relationship that is a mainstay of the
Middle East s security balance  Beneath the pomp  Riyadh will be
looking for assurances that the Trump administration will continue its
notably harsher tone toward Iran and keep up pressure  through both
rhetoric and action  to stop what Saudi Arabia sees as Tehran s
destabilizing activities in the region  The U S  Saudi alliance has
experienced turbulence since Riyadh faulted what it saw as Obama s
withdrawal from the region  a perceived tilt toward Iran since the
2011 Arab uprisings and a lack of direct action against Syrian
President Bashar al Assad  an Iranian ally  Saudi Arabia will also
want to showcase high profile investment deals with American companies
to show progress on its ambitious  Vision 2030  economic and social
reform agenda  while Washington says U S  arms sales arms worth tens
of billions of dollars are in the pipeline  Trump s visit to Saudi
Arabia is the first stop on his maiden international trip since taking
office in January  U S  and Saudi officials are eager to highlight the
powerful symbolism of an American president choosing to visit the
birthplace of Islam as his first stop rather than to neighbors Canada
or Mexico  Besides meeting with Saudi officials  Trump will also meet
with leaders of the six nation Gulf Cooperation Council  GCC  and have
lunch with leaders of more than 50 Muslim countries  Critics have
accused Trump of being anti Muslim after he issued a ban  now blocked
by U S  courts  on entry into the United States by citizens of several
Muslim majority countries  citing national security concerns  U S
public opinion of Saudi Arabia has never fully recovered since the
Sept  11  2001 attacks in which 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi  The
U S  Congress last year passed the Justice Against Sponsors of
Terrorism Act  a law permitting lawsuits holding Saudi Arabia
responsible for the attacks  The Saudi government has long denied
involvement  Trump s visit  sends a clear message that the U S  is
standing with its close allies in the region and that they re not
abandoning them   a senior Saudi official told Reuters  reflecting the
view many Gulf leaders had of Obama  who they considered had made
securing a nuclear deal with Iran a higher priority than the U S  Gulf
alliance  Obama s visit to Saudi Arabia in April 2016 was overshadowed
by Gulf Arab exasperation with his approach to the region  and doubts
about Washington s commitment to regional security    This  new
administration comes in and     says   No  wait a minute  Iran is
active    the official said  referring to Gulf states  views of Iran s
involvement through proxies in regional conflicts in Syria  Iraq
Bahrain and Yemen  The Trump administration has called the nuclear
agreement with Iran  the worst deal ever negotiated   and senior
administration officials have repeatedly criticized Iran s behavior
for its support for Assad  its ballistic missile activities and its
support for militant groups in the region  Mustafa Alani  the director
of security and defense at the Jeddah based Gulf Research Center think
tank  said that beyond U S  rhetoric  Gulf leaders would like to see
America classify Iranian supported militias as terrorist groups
SUPPORT IN YEMEN Saudi Arabia will also be looking for further U S
support in the war in Yemen  where a Saudi led coalition has been
fighting the loosely Iran aligned Houthi group and troops loyal to
former President Ali Abdullah Saleh to restore the internationally
recognized government to power  The Obama administration backed Saudi
Arabia when it launched air strikes in Yemen in March 2015 but grew
sour as it saw the number of civilian casualties grow and curtailed
some military support to Riyadh  By contrast   we don t get criticized
about the war in Yemen  by the Trump administration  the senior Saudi
official said  In Trump s meeting with GCC leaders  the discussion
will revolve around how to strengthen the structures of the group
which includes Bahrain  Kuwait  Oman  Qatar  Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates  to be more effective  a senior White House
official said  The Republican U S  president along with first lady
Melania Trump will dine with Saudi royal family members  Trump  known
for his penchant for Twitter  will participate in a Twitter forum with
young people  National Security Advisor H R  McMaster said on Tuesday
Trump will deliver a speech on  the need to confront radical ideology
and participate in the inauguration of a new center intended  to fight
radicalism and promote moderation   McMaster said   While Trump has
criticized Saudi Arabia for not paying enough for U S  military
support  he has been silent since becoming president about its
religious conservatism  Traditional Wahhabi doctrine is ultra
conservative  imposing a strict version of Islamic law and urging
resumption of early Muslim practices  Critics of the kingdom say the
government does not do enough to prevent the teachings of some of its
ultra conservative clergy from fanning militancy overseas as well as a
domestic security threat at home  Radicalization of Muslims in the
world s top oil exporter has led to domestic attacks and the
involvement of Saudi citizens in jihadist movements in Iraq and Syria
The senior clergy have denounced militant Islamic doctrines  such as
those of al Qaeda or Islamic State  but still preach intolerant views
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES An inaugural Saudi U S  CEO forum will be held
in Riyadh on Saturday in which several deals are expected to be signed
in defense  electricity  oil and gas  industrial and chemical sectors
New licenses for U S  companies to operate in the Kingdom also will be

expected to visit Saudi Arabia after Trump to try to lure a listing by
Aramco  slated for 2018 and worth about  100 billion  World stock
exchanges are vying for slices of Aramco s initial public offering
expected to be the largest in history  with Hong Kong currently the
frontrunner among bourses in Asia because of its strategic links to
key Saudi oil importer China   The NYSE delegation will have tough

176,Old machines show why Trump tax breaks may not spark new company spending,"By Timothy Aeppel CLEVELAND  Reuters    Hanging on the wall of David
Shippoli s office at a sprawling factory here is his company s annual
scavenger award  a stuffed hyena head  given to the employee who finds
the cheapest way to execute an investment project in the past year
Shippoli  a manufacturing engineer at Dan T  Moore Co   a privately
held company which operates nine factories across Ohio and Indiana
won the prize for finding used machines that were a fraction of the
cost of buying them new   Graphic    He is a fan of President Donald
Trump s policies and even propped a bright red  Make America Great
Again  hat on the hyena during the campaign  But Shippoli embodies a
mindset that exists across industrial America that will make it hard
to boost business investment  even if the corporate tax breaks floated
recently by the Trump administration come through   I don t know why
anyone would buy new equipment when there s so much stuff out there
that s perfectly capable of doing the job   he said  Many U S
companies emerged from the last recession extremely wary of spending
on buildings and expensive new equipment  unless it was sure the
returns would justify it   Trump Administration officials forecast
torrid economic growth on the back of the windfall U S  companies
would get if Trump s plan to cut corporate tax rates and slash taxes
on cash parked overseas became law  U S  Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin and White House economic advisor Gary Cohn met on Wednesday
with the full Senate Finance Committee about the administration s
framework for tax reform   CEOs certainly are enthusiastic about the
prospect of tax reform  A recent survey by the Business Roundtable   a
group representing major U S  corporations   found more than eight out
of ten said they thought tax reform would prompt companies to boost
capital spending  Seventy six percent said it would fuel hiring  And
some companies such as  General Electric  Co  N GE  are making big
bets that new digital systems will improve efficiency on factory
floors   But it is unclear how they would use the extra cash if it
doesn t lead to a jump in economic growth  Previous tax holidays aimed
at getting companies to repatriate foreign savings have done little to
boost investment in the U S   Nobody builds a new factory unless they
need the capacity  and tax breaks won t change that  said Susan Helper
an economist at Case Western Reserve University  who has studied how
companies curbed their spending habits in recent years   She notes
that U S  companies are sitting on plenty of cash    1 8 trillion
according to Moody s Investors Service   so it is not that they lack
resources  she says  What is missing is the kind of business
opportunities that justify the spending  ARCONIC S 80 YEAR OLD
MACHINES It s not just smaller companies and startups that appreciate
age in some industrial machines   Across town  for instance  at
Arconic Inc s  N ARNC  sprawling Cleveland Works  workers still use a
1930s metal press confiscated from Germany after World War II to stamp
out aluminum parts  Arconic  based in New York  was created last year
when  Alcoa  Inc  N AA  split in two   creating Alcoa Corp  N AA  and
Arconic  which took the downstream aluminum processing business
Arconic has plenty of other vintage machines  including an even larger
50 ton press in Cleveland built in the 1950s  which it recently spent
100 million completely renovating  The update included fixing metal
parts that had begun to crack as well as new controls that made it
more precise  This new style of thrift is visible in the numbers  The
average age of industrial equipment in the U S  has gone up steadily
over the last decade and now hovers at levels not seen since the 1940s
The average age of a machine is 10 years  according the Bureau o f
Economic Analysis  well above the seven or eight year range that was
common during the 1960s and 1970s   For a graphic  click  The trend
isn t limited to factory machines  The average age of information
processing equipment used by businesses  which includes computers as
well as communications devices  has drifted up steadily since the year
2000 and now stands at five years the highest level since the dawn of
the computer age   You have to be frugal to survive   said Steve
Peplin  CEO of privately held Talan Products Inc   which sells about
40 million in building materials each year  When he needed a new press
recently  he bought an used machine and sent it to a company that
specializes in modernizing such equipment    It was literally rebuilt
he said   It got new high efficiency motors and all computer controls
The reason to go down that road was simple  The whole project cost
about  1 5 million versus the  2 5 million he was quoted to buy a new
machine  BUYING USED The big coup last year for Dan T  Moore s
Shippoli was buying used machines from a factory in California that is
allowing him to set up a new production line for  140 000 instead of
the  3 million it would have cost new  The line will produce an
insulated material the company forms into different shapes and aims to
sell to carmakers and other large manufacturers  Case Western s Helper
said there s  good thrift and bad thrift   If companies refuse to
invest in new capabilities or processes  that is bad because it holds
back productivity gains  Good thrift  by contrast  is the growing
recognition that existing industrial machines are often good enough to
get the job done  so splurging on new equipment isn t necessary  Dan
Moore  the CEO of Shippoli s company  has made the former approach
almost a cult at his operations   One of his favorite sayings is that
steel doesn t know how old it is   meaning the basic components of
many industrial machines remain useful for decades  The company will
typically invest in new computer controls and other components to
update the machines it buys  Not only does Moore reward people who
find ways to use old machines to meet new needs  he has been known to

whether the part can be reused or must be scrapped   It s definitely
faster   he says   Spahn s workbench in this 240 000 square foot plant
is one small example of a multibillion dollar bet by GE Chief
Executive Jeff Immelt  digital technology will transform GE s

ranging from tiny sensors in jet engines to augmented reality and
software that can crunch large volumes of data   is on the scale of

slowed sharply in recent years  By 2020  spending on such systems is
expected to exceed  500 billion a year  up from  20 billion in 2012
according to an estimate cited by consulting firm Accenture  GE says
the market for the sectors it is in will be  225 billion by 2020   The
company has spent  5 billion setting up new U S  factories in the last
five years  As it now adds digital technology to its plants  it needs
fewer  and higher skilled  workers than in the past    We re going to
have a smarter worker   Immelt said in an interview   We re not going
to have as many workers   But as investment grows  so have concerns
about whether these bets will pay off   and about the cost and
complexity of keeping networked machines running and secure from
hackers  GE investors are especially impatient for returns  Since

Immelt  When activist investor Nelson Peltz bought a  2 5 billion GE
stake in 2015  he pressed for asset sales and cost cutting  and barely
mentioned GE s digital strategy as a source of growth  Trian declined
to comment for this article   In March  Peltz reached an agreement
with GE that tied the bonuses of top executives to cutting  2 billion
in costs and hitting profit targets through 2017  Those targets don t
rely on GE s digital strategy    People aren t saying they don t like
the technology  or that GE is investing too much in digital  said
Deane Dray  an analyst at RBC Capital Markets   But how does it
translate into profit margins and cash    DIGITAL VISION  GE poses an
important test of the digital factory idea  It has more than 500
factories around the globe that produce jet engines  power plants
medical CT scanners and other large  sophisticated equipment adaptable
to the technology   GE also earns very little from selling hardware
Nearly half of its revenue and most of its profit come from selling
services  a natural fit for the monitoring and data analysis that are
the core of a computerized factory  In addition to improving its own
productivity  GE sells the  Brilliant Factory  as a product  promising
a combination of its digital systems with advanced manufacturing
techniques  3 D printing and lean production principles pioneered by
Toyota Motor Corp  T 7203    Take the industrial operating system
called Predix  GE spent more than  1 billion to create it along with
applications that can analyze terabytes of data from jet engines or
factory machines along with other data  such as weather or energy
costs   GE s venture capital arm is buying stakes in startups that
adapt robots  optical scanners and augmented reality to work with
Predix  Last year  GE spent  1 1 billion on two makers of industrial 3
D printers  planning both to use the printers and sell them   Predix
systems work  in part  by creating a computerized model  or  digital
twin   of a machine that shows in real time how it is performing  and
when parts are wearing out  This can eliminate unplanned breakdowns
GE says  saving time and money   The system also creates a  digital
thread  that logs  like a medical record  every aspect of a machine s
life   from initial assembly to repairs during its years of operation
RAPID DEPLOYMENT  At GE s Grove City factory  digital systems that
were installed in the last 18 months time workers down to the second
Flat screens over work bays count how long crews are spending and turn
red when jobs are taking too long    I can look at that screen and see
everything I need to know about how things are running   said Richard
Simpson  vice president of supply chain at GE Transportation  pointing
to a display   Even though it is still a grimy  greasy industrial shop
Grove City is one of 17  showcases  GE plans to have by year end
helping it sell its systems to outside customers   When a massive
railroad engine rolls in for repair  workers check the digital twin to
see what parts need to be fixed  The system ensures spares are in
stock  Older engines are fitted with sensors so they can supply that
data next time  The process saves labor by eliminating unnecessary
work   Instead of full tear downs  the factory workers can refurbish
just the parts that need it   said Anup Sharma  a general manager at
GE Digital   That frees them up to do value added work and gets the
engine back to the customer sooner   GE executives say the company has
reaped  1 billion in productivity gains during the last two years
with  700 million more expected in 2017  Those gains are being
reinvested into Predix and applications  so they have not had a large
effect on GE s earnings  the executives said  The gains are not broken

jump 25 percent to  5 billion this year  said GE digital division CEO
Ruh  resulting in  4 billion in revenue for the division from sales to

division  will become real for investors  when it begins to boost

making  are raising questions among corporate strategy experts about
its focus  The Seattle based company wowed Wall Street again this week
with a 23 percent jump in sales  pushing its shares to an all time
high  But there are concerns that if blockbuster growth stops
investors may come to regard the company more like a conglomerate
stock   worth less than the sum of its pieces   High growth covers a
lot of sins   said Harry Kraemer  a partner at private equity firm
Madison Dearborn Partners and a professor at Northwestern University s
Kellogg School of Management   Picture yourself running the company
where one minute we re talking about how we re going to operate air
cargo  and the next minute we re going to talk about artificial

studio in Hollywood  seem further afield  Amazon says the video foray
has allowed it to stream unique programming to members of its Prime
shopping club  thereby increasing sign ups for a program that
encourages people to buy more goods  more often  The financial success
of the investment is difficult to assess  Revenue from Prime

does not disclose the costs of content for its Prime Video service
but they were estimated by an analyst to be more than  3 billion in
2016  Amazon did not respond to a request for comment   OUT OF FASHION
These days  conglomerates like GE are out of fashion in the corporate
world  By a standard method of valuation   comparing a company s share
price to its earnings per share   Amazon is worth about 10 times more
than storied conglomerates Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  Inc and

percent per year from 2002 to 2010  while  focused  companies grew by
9 2 percent  Amazon has acknowledged its pursuits point in many
directions  but stresses they are for the long term  not for quick

list of investments from retail in India to drones and artificial

an attempt to explain why its operating profit margin had thinned in
North America   I know I m drifting a bit from North America  but it s
all part of the same theme   he told analysts  For now at least
Amazon is being treated as a special case in part from the halo effect
around its billionaire founder Jeff Bezos  the second richest person
alive  Many view Bezos as an entrepreneurial genius  he s already
extended his reach beyond Amazon to start a space exploration company
and purchase the Washington Post   Bezos gets a longer leash to wander
around than the typical CEO   said Erik Gordon  a professor at the
University of Michigan s Ross School of Business  But he was not
convinced it was entirely justified    You hesitate to bet on this

country s version of the  Nifty 50  index as their love affair with
trendy small caps fades amid a regulatory crackdown on speculation and
concerns that the economy may lose momentum later in the year  The
shift in investor preference has also been fueled by a desire for more
stable returns  and a burst in supply of listed start ups favored by
smaller punters seeking quick gains  The term  Nifty 50  originally
referred to a group of 50 U S  stocks favored by institutional
investors in the 1960s and 1970s  including stalwarts like  General

some 38 percent this year and hit record highs this week  while
Kweichow Moutai became the world s biggest liquor maker by market
capitalization  dethroning British distiller  Diageo  Plc  L DGE   Big
cap stocks have always had a stable and loyal following among
institutional investors in China  but have lacked the magnetism of
small caps in a country where the retail investing culture is imbued
with a high appetite for risk   The upward trend for blue chips like
Moutai is not yet over   Eastmoney Securities strategist Zhang Jiadai
said  citing Moutai s generous dividend payouts and  modest  valuation
at roughly 24 times forward earnings  The brokerage s blue chip
Eastmoney Nifty 50 Index has gained over 5 percent so far this year
outperforming the market benchmark Shanghai Composite  SSEC   which is
up roughly 2 percent  Meanwhile  investors are dumping small caps
with the growth board ChiNext  down nearly 6 percent  Zhang predicted
that bearish trend  will last for a long time   potentially halving
the index s valuations from the current level   DRAMATIC REVERSAL Such
divergence underscores a dramatic reversal from Chinese investors
strong preference for small caps over blue chips since 2009  creating
huge valuation gaps  Even after this year s sharp correction  ChiNext
still trades at an earnings multiple of roughly 50  while the SME
board is around 40  In contrast  the SSE50 Index  SSE50   another
gauge that some liken to China s  Nifty 50   trades at price earnings
ratio under 10  Interest in small caps is quickly waning as regulators
have restricted reckless fundraising  blocked  blind  acquisitions and
vowed to  brandish the sword  against speculation   There had been a
lot of speculative interest in small caps  because high valuations
allowed them to raise money cheaply to fund acquisitions and thus
maintain rapid growth   said Zhou Liang  fund manager at Minority
Asset Management Co   Once they can no longer keep playing this game
they reveal their true features   Zhou said  adding he would not be
surprised to see the average valuation of ChiNext shares halve over
the next two to three years   In addition  regulators are loosening
the tap on initial public offerings  IPOs   flooding the market with
newly listed start ups and this depressing valuation of small caps in
general   Fund manager Zhou predicted that blue chips will continue to
rally due to their relatively low valuations and stable returns
saying it is  a new cycle that has just started   Hou Bin  a fund
manager at Goldstate Capital Fund Management Co  said he favored
modestly priced banking and home appliance stocks  because  when
liquidity conditions tend to tighten  and risk appetite is low  stocks
with high valuations will be dumped   But Wu Kan  head of equity

painful process for discerning investors    As the bubble deflates

before the Chapter 11 filing  Hatazawa s role would be temporary  he
added  Roderick  described by industry and company insiders as more
salesman than engineer  was the driving force behind Toshiba s nuclear
ambitions  Toshiba said the executive change  only the second to be
made at the top level since the Westinghouse crisis began to unfold in
December  was intended to reassure clients in advance of the
bankruptcy filing  Shigenori Shiga  a former Westinghouse boss
resigned as Toshiba s chairman earlier this year  Calls to Roderick
seeking comment went unanswered  A source familiar with the matter
said Jeffrey Benjamin  responsible for delivering on new power plant
projects had also left  Benjamin did not immediately respond to a

recover from the impact of Fukushima  But billions of dollars of cost
overruns at four reactors under construction in the U S  southeast

183,Adidas to mass produce 3D printed shoe with Silicon Valley start up,"By Emma Thomasson and Aleksandra Michalska HERZOGENAURACH  Germany NEW
YORK  Reuters    Adidas  DE ADSGN  launched a new sneaker on Friday
with a 3D printed sole that it plans to mass produce next year  part
of a broader push by the German sportswear firm to react faster to
changing fashions and create more customized products  Adidas already
lets people customize the color and pattern of shoes ordered online
but new 3D printing methods will make small production runs  limited
edition shoes and even soles designed to fit an individual s weight
and gait economical  Rivals  Nike   NYSE NKE   Under Armour and New
Balance have also been experimenting with 3D printing but have so far
only used the technique to make prototypes  soles tailored for
sponsored athletes and a handful of high priced novelty shoes  That s
because traditional 3D printers are slower  more expensive and often
create an inferior product than the injection moulds for plastic that
are currently used to produce hundreds of millions of shoes each year
mostly in Asia  However  Adidas says its new partnership with Silicon
Valley start up Carbon allows it to overcome many of those
difficulties to produce a sole that can rival one made by an injection
mould  and at a speed and price that allow for mass production    This
is a milestone not only for us as a company but also for the industry
said Gerd Manz  Adidas head of technology innovation  announcing the
launch of its new  Futurecraft 4D  shoe   We ve cracked some of the
boundaries   Carbon  financed by venture firms such as Sequoia Capital
as well as funds set up by  General Electric   NYSE GE  and Alphabet s
Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   has pioneered a technique that prints with
light sensitive polymer resin that is then baked for strength
Standard 3D printers build up products with layers of plastic powder
a method used by Hewlett Packard which is working with Nike and says
its newest machines work 10 times faster and at half the cost than
earlier models  Adidas hopes to sell 5 000 pairs of its  Futurecraft
4D  this year  and 100 000 next year as Carbon cuts the time it takes
to print a sole from the current hour and a half to as low as 20
minutes per sole  The shoes will sell at an unspecified premium price
but Adidas plans to lower the cost as the technology develops  Late
last year Adidas sold a few hundred pairs of running shoes with soles
made by regular 3D printing for  333 but they were relatively rigid
and heavy and took 10 hours to print   WALK BEFORE YOU RUN  Carbon s
technology will allow Adidas to make small batches of shoes far more
quickly  Small production runs were not economical before as the metal
moulds for most soles need to be used 10 000 times to pay for
themselves  and they take four to six weeks to cast and grind   What
you can do is introduce more types of products without a cost penalty
said Terry Wohlers  head of Wohlers Associates  a U S  consultancy
specializing in 3D printing   With this technology  you can produce
one or a few inexpensively   Wohlers expects the 3D printing industry
to more than quadruple sales to  26 billion by 2022  driven mostly by
the automotive  medical  dental and jewelry sectors   Adidas initially
plans batches of shoes tailored to specific sports or cities but hopes
consumers will eventually be measured and tested in store to design
perfectly fitting shoes tweaked for an individual s gait  weight and
type of sport   Individualization will come  but you ve got to learn
to walk before you run   Manz said  citing a survey that shows 80
percent of consumers want to be part of the design process  Adidas
last month experimented with a pop up store where customers could
design a custom fitted sweater and have it knitted in the store  3D
printing will also help cut the time it takes to get new designs to
stores from the 12 to 18 months it usually takes for sneakers  To that
end  Adidas is also opening factories mainly operated by robots in
Germany and the United States",2017-04-07,Reuters

185,Boeing  aerospace manufacturers back U S  tax overhaul,"By Alwyn Scott SEATTLE  Reuters    Boeing  NYSE BA  Co and about 90
other aerospace companies are urging Congress to overhaul the U S  tax
system  saying a set of changes Republicans proposed last year
including a big cut in the corporate tax rate   will make them more
competitive globally and help create U S  jobs  Boeing Chief Executive
Dennis Muilenburg was among those who signed a letter to Republican
and Democratic leaders in the U S  House and Senate that was dated
Friday and due to be released publicly on Tuesday  according to the
Aerospace Industries Association  AIA   The support comes as
congressional Republicans are developing measures to alter the U S
tax system  a task they plan to tackle after addressing healthcare
according to several people familiar with the matter    We urge you to
enact legislation that modernizes our tax system  allows America s
businesses to better compete in the global marketplace and encourages
job creation and innovation in the United States   said the AIA letter
also signed by the group s CEO  David Melcher  The changes are based
on a blueprint released in June by House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Kevin Brady  a Texas Republican  Among its key elements
Brady s proposal would cut the U S  corporate tax rate to 20 percent
from 35 percent  permit immediate deductions for capital investment
and introduce a border adjustment tax system that would tax imports
into the United States but not tax revenue generated by exports out of
the country  The push on taxes by aerospace companies comes as they
face some uncertainty under the administration of President Donald
Trump   The new president lost no time in publicly pressing Boeing and
Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT  to lower costs on planes bought by
the U S  government  As they source parts and sell many of their
products overseas  aerospace companies also stand to suffer if Trump s
aggressive trade policies cause friction with other countries   Trump
has voiced support for the tax reform plan  and spoke favorably about
a border tax  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross later said Trump had not
endorsed the House Republicans  specific border adjustment tax plan
Drafters of the plan say a tax on imports would increase the value of
the dollar  helping offset the cost of imports to U S  manufacturers
by giving them more purchasing power  A stronger dollar would  however
make U S  goods more expensive for foreign buyers   Boeing s
Muilenburg is AIA chairman this year and was joined in signing the
letter by Raytheon Co CEO and AIA vice chairman Thomas Kennedy  Other

186,Trump  conservatives try to put aside bitterness to cut tax deal,"By Roberta Rampton  Richard Cowan and Amanda Becker WASHINGTON
Reuters    Raw feelings and mistrust could pose an obstacle to
President Donald Trump and hard line conservative lawmakers in his
Republican Party as they seek to rebound from defeat on healthcare
legislation by launching into an overhaul of the U S  tax code  Trump
has accused the Freedom Caucus lawmakers of snatching a  defeat from
the jaws of victory  with their rejection of the White House backed
healthcare bill to replace President Barack Obama s 2010 healthcare
reform bill  In interviews with 10 of the roughly three dozen House
Freedom Caucus members  the lawmakers said they were eager to put
aside tensions over the healthcare debacle and seek common ground on
tax reform  But there is no consensus  even within the conservative
faction  on details of a tax reform bill  with some members open to
discussing ideas such as the border tax plan supported by House
leaders and others opposed to it  Representative Warren Davidson  a
Freedom Caucus member from Ohio  said Republicans should leave aside
the blame game and work through their policy differences before
launching tax reform legislation   Some people are still in that hurt
feelings and frustration  stage  Davidson said   I do think it s smart
to take the time to get it right   Republican Representative David
Schweikert of Arizona  a Freedom Caucus lawmaker who sits on the tax
writing House of Representative Ways and Means Committee  could emerge
as a bridge between the conservative faction and House leaders  The
panel will work closely with House leadership on the tax bill
Schweikert said he planned to consult with rank and file members to
discuss plans and listen to their priorities  He said giving companies
incentives to invest in plants and equipment was one of the items on
his own wish list   My personal fixation is very simple  What
maximizes economic growth   Schweikert said  CUTS  CUTS AND MORE CUTS
Representative Mark Meadows  chairman of the Freedom Caucus  said the
group has  no formal position  on the structure of tax reform
legislation  But Meadows listed the top priorities on his own wish
list   Lower taxes  lower taxes and lower taxes   A 35 page blueprint
developed by House Republican leaders  known as a  Better Way   will
serve as a starting point for the tax reform discussions  The plan
calls for streamlining the income tax system and cutting the corporate
income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent  It would exclude export
revenue from taxable income and impose a 20 percent tax on imports
The border tax proposal has divided the business community and is a
top flashpoint for lawmakers  Big exporters such as  General Electric
NYSE GE  Co say the tax would boost manufacturing and jobs  But
retailers like  Target  Corp  NYSE TGT  have said the border tax would
hike consumer prices and hurt the economy  Trump  a businessman who
had never been in public office until he took over at the White House
on Jan  20  has at times praised the border tax idea but at other
times has been noncommittal  Virginia Congressman Dave Brat said he
would insist that the tax bill not add to the deficit  while Meadows
said he would not necessarily insist on that  Other conservatives said
they needed more information about the tax bill to form an opinion
and some space from the contentious health care debate   We just had a
major battle on a Republican welfare plan and that has consumed to a
large degree my time and mental effort   said Alabama Representative
Mo Brooks   When we have a tax reform bill I can evaluate  that s when
I ll start voting on it   Brooks said  As a sign of tensions that have
lingered after the collapse of the healthcare bill  Freedom Caucus
lawmakers faced tough questioning from their colleagues during a
closed door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday  said
Representative Randy Weber of Texas  But Weber said some of the
friction eased by the end of the meeting  prompting House Speaker Paul
Ryan to say that more give and take might have been useful in the
healthcare effort   Ryan said   This is what we should have been doing
Weber told Reuters  Republican Representative Ken Buck of Colorado  a
member of the Freedom Caucus  said he thinks lawmakers learned lessons
from the healthcare defeat that could apply to tax reform   I think
people are going to work harder to get to  yes  this next piece of
legislation   Buck said   A Reuters Ipsos opinion poll released on
Wednesday showed Republicans mostly blame Congress  and not Trump or
party leaders  for failing to pass the healthcare overhaul",2017-03-30,Reuters

189,Withdrawal of GE s Nason leaves Fed job up in the air,"By Pete Schroeder and Olivia Oran  Reuters    David Nason  a  General
Electric   N GE  executive and former Treasury Department official
has told the White House he is no longer interested in serving as the
Federal Reserve s bank supervision chief  Nason  who heads GE s Energy
Financial Services division  had been seen as a leading candidate for
the vice chair for supervision position  a critical role in efforts by
the administration of President Donald Trump to revamp financial rules
Mr  Nason informed the White House that he no longer wished to be
considered for the position of Vice Chairman at the Federal Reserve
He plans to pursue opportunities at GE   the company said in a
statement on Wednesday  Nason s withdrawal  first reported by
Bloomberg  injects new uncertainty into one of the most closely
watched financial openings in Washington  The supervision chief is the
most senior rule writer for Wall Street and has a large say in how
leading banks are supervised day to day  Jaret Seiberg  a policy
analyst at investment banking and research firm Cowen Group  said
Nason s departure is  worrisome  for large banks  as it suggests a
pragmatist  open to providing relief to bigger institutions will not
fill the position   National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn was
unable to get the President to pull trigger and nominate Nason   wrote
Seiberg   If Cohn cannot get a pragmatist into that job  then there is
a real risk of an ideologue    This could be seen as a victory for the
Trumpista wing of the administration and the more hardline segment of
the Republican Party   wrote Ian Katz  a financial policy analyst for
research firm Capital Alpha Partners  in a note to clients  In 2008
Nason was a deputy to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson as U S
regulators tried to stabilize Wall Street and prevent an economic
meltdown after the housing market collapsed  While Nason was the
leading contender for the role  congressional Republicans became
increasingly unhappy with the idea over the past week or so  sources
said  Conservative lawmakers took issue with Nason s involvement as a
Treasury Department official in the post financial crisis bank bailout
program  as well as with his voicing of support for the Dodd Frank
financial reform law that came in response to the 2008 financial
crisis  they said  Harvard Law School professor Hal Scott  whose work
has focused on financial firms  regulation and capital markets  is
still in the mix for the job  a person familiar with the matter told
Reuters  Scott is director of the Committee on Capital Markets
Regulation  a research group made up of financial industry
representatives and academics that has been critical of financial
regulations  Some regional banks are also pushing for French Hill  a
Republican Congressman from Arkansas who has community banking
experience  However  a spokesman for Hill suggested Wednesday he is
not interested in the role  Other names that have been floated for the
role include Richard Davis  the chief executive officer of U S
Bancorp  N USB   former BB T Corp  N BBT  Chairman John Allison  and
Tom Hoenig  vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
The position was created by the Dodd Frank Wall Street reform law
after the 2007 09 financial crisis  Though it was never filled  Daniel
Tarullo  who announced his resignation in February as Fed governor
took on much of its responsibilities  When Tarullo leaves the U S
central bank  on or around April 5  Trump will have three spots on the
seven member Fed Board of Governors he could fill with nominees
Tarullo s resignation is seen as boosting Trump s plans to ease
reforms put in place after the financial crisis",2017-03-08,Reuters
190,Top Federal Reserve official resigns as bank deregulation looms,"By Jason Lange and Lisa Lambert WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Federal
Reserve Board s top bank regulator said on Friday he would resign
giving a boost to President Donald Trump s plans to ease reforms put
in place after the 2007 09 financial crisis  Daniel Tarullo  a strong
regulator who was dovish on monetary policy in his seven years on the
board  said in his resignation letter to Trump he would leave the U S
central bank on or around April 5  With his resignation  Trump will
have three positions to fill on the Fed s Board of Governors  which at
full strength has seven members  Much of Tarullo s legacy involves
erecting safeguards after the 2007 2009 financial crisis and
accompanying recession  where big banks crumbled or were driven by the
Fed and U S  Treasury into shotgun mergers intended to make them
stronger   With the goal of never needing taxpayer bailouts of failed
banks  Tarullo has been strict about carrying out the 2010 Dodd Frank
Wall Street reform law and administering rigorous  stress tests
annually to banks on how prepared they are to withstand unexpected
shocks  The tests gave Tarullo huge control over the largest U S
banks  Performance in the exams dictates how much money they can
return to shareholders in dividends or spend on stock buybacks
Failure puts bank bosses under pressure and lenders devote thousands
of staff and hundreds of millions of dollars to passing the tests
Tarullo has also pushed for bigger capital buffers and other checks on
potential risks banks may pose to the world s financial system  His
departure leaves many questions about the future of financial
regulation  Tarullo sees the direction of changes under Trump as
unclear  but said he expects the core elements put in place during his
tenure of increasing capital requirements  risk management  and a
resolution regime for big banks may survive   I m hopeful that they
really do command a broad enough consensus that this was a way to
combat the  too big to fail  problems which obviously bedeviled the
system in the years leading up to and in the crisis itself   he said
in an interview with Reuters  One bank executive  who declined to be
quoted by name  said the industry is relieved the Tarullo era is over
Bankers had long complained he and his staff kept changing the stress
tests and balance sheet reviews in ways that arbitrarily ratcheted up
capital requirements behind closed doors   He made up rules in a black
box and would not bother to explain their rationale to banks   the
executive said  Tarullo said changes to the stress tests  known by the
acronym CCAR  that he and Yellen have proposed  on including capital
buffers and a Global Systemically Important Bank surcharge  are
moving along right now    It s going to provide more certainty to the
banks about what the next final stage of CCAR will look like   he said
Liberal and progressive groups said Tarullo had fought to protect
Americans from another financial crisis or economic catastrophe
Governor Tarullo has stood steadfast as a sentinel on the front lines
of a six year war to turn the Dodd Frank financial reform law into a
reality   said Dennis Kelleher  president of Better Markets  a group
created to promote economic stability  Besides crafting regulation
Tarullo is a voter on interest rate policy  with a record of tending
toward caution on raising rates  The Fed signaled in December it could
raise rates three times this year  Tarullo plans to attend the March
meeting  LIFE AFTER TARULLO Bank stocks moved higher in the moments
following Tarullo s resignation announcement  with the S P banks
industry group index rising 0 35 percent  The Trump administration has
already said it would appoint a new Fed governor charged with heading
financial regulation  a post created in Dodd Frank  Tarullo was never
formally confirmed for it  but stepped into the role  In addition to
the three appointments Trump will be able to make soon  he will be
able to nominate a replacement for Fed chief Janet Yellen when her
four year term as chair ends in January 2018  Fed Vice Chairman
Stanley Fischer also completes his term in 2018  David Nason  a former
deputy to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in 2008 and  General
Electric   NYSE GE  executive  is the front runner for the regulation
post  according to sources familiar with the matter  John Allison  a
former BB T  NYSE BBT  CEO who has said he would like to abolish the
Fed  has also been mentioned as a potential nominee   In recent months
Tarullo sharply questioned moves by Republican lawmakers to roll back
post crisis regulations  putting him at odds with House Financial
Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling  Last year he criticized
Hensarling s proposal to give banks a choice between complying with
Dodd Frank or holding higher amounts of capital  saying the capital
ratio was too low  Hensarling is expected to introduce a new draft of
the bill soon",2017-02-10,Reuters

cover all workers who lose their jobs due to global trade  The lost
jobs amount to a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of U S
workers employed by those involved in the meeting  General Electric
for example  employs 125 000 U S  workers  financial filings show  On
the campaign trail and in the White House  Trump has painted
globalization as a zero sum game that has enriched low wage countries
while leaving the United States littered with abandoned factories and
underemployed workers  and he has threatened to tax companies that
offshore U S  jobs  The experience of companies on Trump s task force
however  shows the reality is more complex in a world where they are
serving customers across the globe  Several said they were creating
many new U S  factory jobs even as they move work to other countries
It s not clear whether Trump will opt for the carrot or the stick
Trump plans to meet business leaders to hear their reasons for  why
they re going offshore   said a White House aide who spoke on
condition of anonymity   Blue collar workers who share Trump s
skepticism of global trade say they will be watching closely to see if
he will try to save their jobs   I don t think he s a typical
politician  so there is hope alive for middle class families that he
will do something   said Scott Schmidt  one of 222 workers at a GE
engine plant in Waukesha  Wisconsin who are due to lose their jobs
later this year when the company shifts production to Canada   General
Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt is among those due to meet with Trump on
Thursday  GE says it is closing its Waukesha plant because Congress
has hobbled the U S  Export Import Bank s ability to finance large
export orders while most other industrialized nations still offer such
financial support  The company says it laid off 225 workers last year
at a Houston factory for the same reason  shifting production to
France  the United Kingdom and Hungary   GE says it is also closing an
Ohio factory and laying off 180 workers because consumers are buying
fewer of the florescent and incandescent light bulbs they make there
What production remains will be handled by a factory in Hungary
OFFSHORING AND ONSHORING  The U S  economy lost 6 million
manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2010  roughly one third of its total
in part due to offshoring  but the sector has added 900 000 jobs since
then  according to the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics   Multinational
companies say labor costs now are only one factor they consider when
deciding where to manufacture  An auto maker  for example  may decide
to build a particular model in the country where sales are strongest
prompting parts suppliers to set up there as well so they can turn
around orders quickly   The offshoring picture is also more complex
than official statistics indicate as a shuttered factory in the United
States does not always mean a new factory abroad  When auto parts
maker Dana Corp closes a factory later this year in Glasgow  Kentucky
that is operating at 20 percent of capacity  one of its plants in Ohio
will pick up the work  along with other factories in Mexico  India and
China  Dana CEO James Kamsickas is among those scheduled to meet with
Trump on Thursday  The company plans to hire nearly 700 U S  workers
over the next three years as it expands factories in four U S  states
spokesman Jeff Cole said   That is little comfort to the 223 people in
Kentucky who will lose their jobs   It seems like all these CEOs and
companies have turned their backs on the American worker   said Dana
employee Tim Wells  one of those who will be laid off  LAYOFFS STILL
PLANNED The group also includes United Technologies CEO Gregory Hayes
who took heat from Trump last year for planning to move jobs from
Indianapolis to Mexico  The company struck a deal with the incoming
president in November to preserve roughly 700 jobs in exchange for  7
million in tax breaks  United Technologies says it still plans to lay
off 786 workers at a separate Indiana plant and move production to
Mexico this year  The company is also moving work from a facility in
Arden Hills  Minnesota  resulting in a loss of 72 jobs  Most of that
work is staying in the United States but some is moving to Poland
spokeswoman Bethany Sherman said  and some of the affected workers
will be offered positions elsewhere  The company is adding more than 1
000 new jobs in the United States  Sherman said  Other participants
include Caterpillar Chairman Doug Oberhelman  who oversees a company
that is laying off 712 workers in the American South and Midwest and
moving the work to China  Mexico  Italy  France and Germany as it
weathers the largest sales slump in its history  A Caterpillar
spokesman said it is simultaneously creating 1 300 new manufacturing
jobs elsewhere in the United States    Also due to participate is Inge
Thulin  CEO of 3M  which is eliminating 130 jobs in suburban
Cincinnati and moving production to Mexico  The company says it has
added more than 2 000 U S  manufacturing jobs over the last five years",2017-02-23,Reuters

may become a more important force in dealmaking next year as its

Chinese companies from making foreign acquisitions  bankers and
lawyers said  Facing tepid prospects at home after decades of
stagnation amid a shrinking population  Japanese companies had spent

trillion in cash  according to government data  outbound acquisitions
are expected to maintain a fast pace next year  the bank and law firm
sources said  And while the recent weakening of the yen against the

and the United States will draw up a roadmap for deepening their
detente on Wednesday in a first meeting since the election of Donald
Trump as U S  president and the death of Cuban revolutionary Fidel
Castro  The fifth U S  Cuban bilateral commission comes at a time of
increased uncertainty about the future of U S  Cuban relations given
Trump s promise to end the detente if Cuba did not offer a better
deal   The administration of outgoing U S  President Barack Obama has
pressed American companies to complete additional business deals in
Cuba to help further cement the president s policy by the time Trump
takes office on January 20   We will define the actions that will be
carried out in the coming weeks to further the process of improving
relations   the Cuban foreign ministry said on Tuesday  Those actions
would include high level visits and accords of cooperation in areas of
mutual interest  it said  Communist ruled Cuba has so far mostly
stayed quiet on Trump s statements  waiting to see whether he converts
his tough rhetoric into policy change  Several major U S  companies
such as  General Electric   NYSE GE   are in the final stages of
negotiating deals with Cuba  sources familiar with the matter say  One
of those sources  based in Washington  said more than half a dozen
announcements  ranging from cruise ships and travel to manufacturing
and telecommunications  are believed to be in the works  Negotiations
may have been affected by the nine days of official mourning for
Castro  the source said  Castro had given Cuba an outsized influence
in world affairs during his half century as president  partly by
clashing with the United States   His younger brother  Raul Castro
who took over as president in 2008  made history two years ago by
agreeing with Obama to end Cold War hostility and start normalizing
relations   Since then  the two countries have opened embassies
restored commercial flights  opened travel options and negotiated
agreements on issues affecting the environment  law enforcement  the
postal service and communications  Obama  who visited Cuba earlier
this year  has also gradually poked holes in the U S  embargo on the
Caribbean island through executive orders  But Trump says Obama ought
to have cut a  better deal   At a campaign rally in Miami  which has a
large population of Cuban exiles  he said he would seek to reverse
Obama s moves to open relations with Cuba unless its leaders allowed
religious freedoms and freed political prisoners  U S  supporters of
the detente say it is improving Cubans  lives while contributing to
opening the socialist system in place  for example by fostering the
fledgling private sector  A bipartisan group of U S  congressional
leaders and four Cuban entrepreneurs will hold a joint news conference
on Wednesday to urge Congress to lift the U S  embargo on Cuba   The
Cuban entrepreneurs will also urge Trump not to reverse the thaw

198,Obama to press Trump to preserve Cuba detente  White House,"By Matt Spetalnick and Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON  Reuters
President Barack Obama will make his case directly to President elect
Donald Trump not to derail the recent U S  Cuba detente  the White
House said on Tuesday  insisting that  turning back the clock  would
be damaging to American interests and the Cuban people  Ben Rhodes
Obama s deputy national security adviser  said the outgoing
administration hopes to persuade the incoming Trump administration to
preserve Obama s policy of engagement despite the president elect s
threat to roll back the opening with the communist ruled island  Just
weeks before Trump takes office  Obama and his aides are seeking to
further cement one of his top foreign policy legacy initiatives  a
breakthrough between former Cold War foes announced two years ago  But
since Obama eased travel and trade restrictions through executive
actions  Trump would be able to reverse them on his own if he chooses
to do so   Cuba has been and will be on the list of issues where
President Obama will make his case that this is the right approach for
American interests   Rhodes told reporters on a teleconference
referring to transition talks between the two  Trump  who takes office
on Jan  20  has vowed to  terminate  Obama s engagement with Cuba
unless Havana gives the United States what he calls a  better deal
including allowing broader political freedoms on the island  The Cuban
government so far has refrained from commenting on Trump s statements
What we believe would be very damaging is any effort to turn off the
opening   Rhodes said  asserting it would hurt the Cuban people  U S
business interests and Washington s standing in Latin America  He said
the administration has sought to make the policy  irreversible   and
suggested that Trump  a businessman turned politician  should consider
whether it makes sense to roll it back  Rhodes  who played a key role
in negotiating the opening  said a reversal would boost Cuban
hardliners  opposed to engagement as Havana heads into its own
political transition  Cuban President Raul Castro has said he will
step down in 2018   Do you really want to cancel travel plans for
hundreds of thousands of Americans   Rhodes asked   Do you want to
tell businesses as diverse as our major airlines or Google  NASDAQ
GOOGL  or  General Electric   NYSE GE      that have been pursuing
opportunities in Cuba that they have to terminate those activities
Rhodes  who was also in Cuba for memorial services for late Cuban
revolutionary Fidel Castro this month  said Cuban officials were
uncertain about Trump and would wait to see how he proceeded  The
White House is planning a meeting with  stakeholders  on Cuba policy
this week  he said  The administration is pressing Cuba for further
economic reforms  Rhodes said  and encouraging new deals with U S
companies before Obama leaves office  Rhodes also said there was
currently an  incentive structure  for economic change following the
death of Fidel Castro  a vocal critic of detente  but that no progress
has been made on political reforms   U S  critics of Cuba engagement
have accused Obama of making too many concessions  But despite
restoration of relations  the Republican controlled Congress has
resisted lifting the broader U S  economic embargo",2016-12-13,Reuters
199,U S  wind power enjoys a rebirth as solar s obstacles mount,"By Nichola Groom  Reuters    A year after Congress extended generous
tax credits for renewable energy projects  the U S  wind industry is
thriving  Solar power companies  meanwhile  are hunkering down for a
rough 2017  The tax credit renewal has boosted the long term outlooks
for both industries  But in the short term  the subsidies are far more
attractive for wind power  which has spurred utilities to launch wind
projects while they scale back or delay solar installations  Advances
in wind turbine technology are also opening up new locations for
development and driving a wave of spending to upgrade existing
projects  In the last few weeks  power companies with large renewable
holdings   including  Southern Co   N SO    NextEra Energy Inc   N NEE
and  Xcel Energy  Inc  N XEL    have announced plans to invest
billions of dollars in wind   We re making a pivot now away from solar
Southern Chief Executive Tom Fanning told a meeting with Wall Street
analysts in October  The wind industry tax credit is largest for
projects that break ground in 2016 and will decrease each year after
that before expiring at the end of 2019  Solar s tax credit  by
contrast  doesn t start to decline until 2020  giving developers an
incentive to focus on wind projects first  The most popular wind power
tax credit  which lasts for ten years  is worth 2 3 cents for every
kilowatt hour of electricity produced  After this year  however  the
credit s value will drop by 20 percent each year for projects that
start construction from 2017 through 2019  The tax credit used most by
solar developers is worth 30 percent of the value of the project and
must be claimed entirely in the first year  WINDS OF CHANGE
Competition from wind power is hitting solar companies that are
already reeling from a global glut of panels  Prices have dropped 30
percent since the first half of 2016  SunPower Corp  O SPWR  and First
Solar  O FSLR  have both announced deep cost cuts and forecast a
challenging market in 2017  Stocks in both companies have fallen to
their lowest levels in nearly four years  with SunPower shares down 76
percent for the year and First Solar shares down 51 percent  The
number of new U S  solar installations is expected to fall by 4
percent in 2017   after rising 88 percent this year  according to GTM
Research  A sharp decline in utility projects is expected to offset
growth in residential and commercial systems  It would be the first
annual decline in the industry s history  based on additions tracked
back to 2000  GTM Research said  As developers have scaled back solar
plans  wind projects under construction are approaching record levels
and new power contracts for wind facilities are up 39 percent so far
this year  according to the American Wind Energy Association  Xcel
Energy this year announced a major strategy to boost wind energy  with
its Chief Executive Ben Fowke saying the cost of projects is lower now
than it will be for at least a decade   This was the time to take
advantage of wind   he said   While it s on sale  let s get it   Xcel
plans to spend  3 5 billion on renewables  mostly wind  over the next
five years  more than double what it spent over the previous 10 years
Fowke said he expects his company will focus on solar again in coming
years  noting that some of its coal plants are scheduled to be retired
after the wind credit becomes less attractive but before the solar tax
credit is scaled back   Solar  just like wind  will continue to
improve in cost   he said   The best time to bring on a lot of large
scale solar will be towards the end of this decade   TURBINE
TECHNOLOGY Recent advances in turbine efficiency are also driving wind
power development  Until recently  projects only made sense in the
windiest areas   Now  wind projects can be built in areas of medium
and lower wind speeds   said Navigant Research analyst Jesse Broehl
Some wind farm owners plan to use the federal tax credit to replace
older turbines  a practice known as repowering  NextEra Energy  for
instance  said in October that it will spend at least  2 billion to  2
5 billion on repowering projects over the next four years  The company
also plans to develop up to 3 8 GW of wind projects over the next two
years  compared with up to 1 3 GW of solar  Those announcements and

201,Republicans aim to coax Trump toward House trade tax plan,"By David Morgan WASHINGTON  Reuters    Republicans in the U S
Congress hope to convince President elect Donald Trump to support an
untested strategy of using the tax code to promote exports while
slashing corporate taxes  framing it as a way to fulfill his campaign
promises to restore blue collar jobs  The plan would be one way to
help Republican lawmakers reconcile their long standing goal of tax
cuts with the often populist campaign rhetoric of Trump  who has
attacked the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  and other
trade deals as bad for U S  workers  Critics say it risks running
afoul of global trade rules and increasing costs for U S  consumers
Analysts also say that any export gains could be short lived if the
strategy causes the dollar to strengthen  wiping out any price
advantage for U S  products in international markets  It is likely to
undergo months of debate as part of a larger package of proposals
offered in congressional Republicans   A Better Way  economic plan
but at least one Trump adviser already seems to have a favorable view
of the export focused  border adjustability  strategy   If we have a
border adjustable tax system  that can solve a lot of these trade
issues that Trump is talking about   economic analyst and Trump
adviser Stephen Moore said in an interview   You re going to tax what
s imported and not going to tax what s exported  So we re going to
reduce the trade deficit and we re going to have more companies come
in here   Moore said  Border adjustability s details are not clearly
explained in a summary of the  A Better Way  plan from House Speaker
Paul Ryan and House tax committee chairman Kevin Brady  But the Tax
Foundation  a think tank that closely studies business tax policy
said the strategy would be implemented by making revenue from sales to
non U S  residents non taxable  while preventing importers from
deducting the cost of goods bought from non residents  Brady told
Reuters that border adjustability would  virtually eliminate  any tax
incentive for U S  companies to move operations overseas and encourage
foreign investment to return to the United States   We ve got a great
argument  I think   he said  Steven Mnuchin  Trump s pick for U S
Treasury secretary and co author of the president elect s tax plan
described tax reform on Wednesday as  something that happens
absolutely within the first 90 days of this presidency   Wilbur Ross
Trump s nominee for commerce secretary  did not mention tax policy
directly but said the Trump administration s aim would be to increase
exports in part by getting rid of  non tariff  barriers  The perceived
winners under a border adjustability approach would include U S
manufacturers that export heavily  while large volume importers  such
as U S  retailers  could be hurt  That distinction was already
dividing corporate lobbying groups   While retailers support an
overhaul of the tax code   the tax on imports proposed in the House
blueprint is cause for concern for retailers   said Christin Fernandez
spokeswoman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association  a Washington
group  The industry group s members include Wal Mart Stores Inc   Home
Depot  Inc  NYSE HD  and  Target  Corp   NYSE TGT  Some version of
border adjustability could attract support from Democrats  Senator Ben
Cardin  a Maryland Democrat who sits on the Senate Finance Committee
and the panel s tax subcommittee  said he strongly favors the idea
But he called the emerging House plan  very  very questionable
because it would use tax on corporate income rather than a consumption
tax  Tax lawyers and other experts have said such an approach risks
violating long standing world trade rules that allow countries to
adjust their trading positions through indirect taxes  such as a sales
tax  but not with direct taxes like the U S  corporate tax   It would
lead to uncertainty on how it would be treated internationally  And
that s bad for business   Cardin told Reuters   Trump s transition
team and other Trump advisors on the economy did not respond to
requests for comment  Brady has said border adjustability would pass
muster with the World Trade Organization  which polices global trade
The WTO declined to comment on the plan  TRADE WORRIES Border
adjustability is only one component of the  A Better Way  blueprint
It would also slash the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from a
top rate of 35 percent  repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax
and let businesses write off capital investments immediately
Altogether  the House Republicans  corporate tax plan would reduce U S
corporate tax revenues by about  891 billion over 10 years  estimated
the non partisan Tax Policy Center  perpetuating a long term decline
in the corporate tax take  Combined with an equally ambitious package
of individual income tax cut proposals put forward in the  Better Way
package  the Republican plan would boost the federal deficit by about
3 7 trillion over a decade  the center estimated  Advocates of border
adjustability note that U S  trading partners including China use
value added taxes to favor exports over imports and say the House
proposal would level the playing field for U S  companies   But some
tax experts have questioned how effective it would be  Kyle Pomerleau
and Stephen Entin of the Tax Foundation wrote in June that the
increased demand abroad for cheaper U S  made goods would boost the
dollar s value and cancel out gains for exporters  Still  supporters
of the plan believe it could win the favor of the president elect  who
has railed against U S  companies that have shifted production abroad
and scaled back U S  operations  Trump has already ruled out U S
participation in the ambitious Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP  trade
deal and has vowed to renegotiate or quit NAFTA   When Trump
understands how the blueprint works  particularly the border
adjustability provision  which will create a huge incentive to make
stuff in the United States  I think he ll be delirious   said Ken Kies

202,U S  patent agency to weigh rival claims on gene editing technology," Corrects company name to Editas Medicine from Editas Pharmaceuticals
in paragraph 15  By Brendan Pierson  Reuters    The U S  patent agency
on Tuesday will hear arguments in a heated dispute over who was first
to invent a revolutionary gene editing technology known as CRISPR
Hundreds of millions of dollars may be at stake  as the technology
promises commercial applications in treating genetic diseases
engineering crops  and other areas   CRISPR works as a type of
molecular scissors that can trim away unwanted parts of the genome
and replace them with new stretches of DNA  It has quickly become the
preferred method of gene editing in research labs because of its ease
of use compared with older techniques  The hearing is before the U S
Patent and Trademark Office s Patent Trial and Appeal Board in
Alexandria  Virginia  It will pit one group of researchers associated
with the Broad Institute  affiliated with the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and Harvard University  against another group linked to
the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Vienna
in Austria  The latter team  led by Berkeley s Jennifer Doudna and
Vienna s Emmanuelle Charpentier  applied for a CRISPR patent in 2013
The Broad team  led by MIT s Feng Zhang  filed a patent application
months later  and became the first to obtain a CRISPR patent in 2014
It has since obtained additional patents  The Berkeley team has
obtained CRISPR patents as well  though the 2013 application has not
been granted  In April 2015  the Berkeley team petitioned the patent
agency to launch a so called interference proceeding  claiming Broad s
patents covered the same invention as the Berkeley team s 2013
application  Tuesday s hearing will focus on preliminary motions
which the panel is expected to decide within the next few weeks  One
of those motions  filed by Broad  could end the case  Broad has argued
that its patents  which describe the use of CRISPR specifically in
animal cells  represent a breakthrough beyond the Berkeley team s
application  which described it more generally  CRISPR occurs
naturally in bacteria  The two teams  Broad has said  are not really
claiming the same invention at all  If the panel agrees  the
interference proceeding will end  and Broad s patents will remain
intact  Rulings from the panel can be appealed in federal court
Otherwise  the proceeding will likely go on for another year or more
as the panel weighs evidence to determine which team was first to
invent the technology  Broad spokesman Lee McGuire said in a statement
that the institute was confident of its case  Berkeley representatives
could not be reached for comment  The CRISPR dispute is among the last
ever interference proceedings  which were phased out by a 2011 patent
reform law  The America Invents Act changed the U S  patent system
from a  first to invent  to  first inventor to file  for patent
applications after March 16  2013  If the Berkeley team s challenge
succeeds  Broad could lose its patent rights  Broad has already
licensed its CRISPR patents for human therapeutics research to Editas
Medicine  a Cambridge  Massachusetts based biotech firm whose founders
included both Zhang and Doudna  who has since left  It has also
licensed its technology to large businesses  including agriculture
company  Monsanto   NYSE MON  Co and  General Electric   NYSE GE  Co s
medical technology subsidiary GE Healthcare  Doudna co founded
Berkeley biotech firm Caribou Biosciences  which licenses Berkeley s
intellectual property and is working on CRISPR with other companies
including Novartis AG and Dupont  The case is The Broad Institute Inc

203,Siemens plans public listing of healthcare business,"By Georgina Prodhan MUNICH  Reuters    German trains to turbines group
Siemens   DE SIEGn  plans a public listing of its  15 billion
healthcare business  it said on Thursday  in a further step to focus
on its core strengths of factory automation  industrial software and
energy technology  Executives signaled that Siemens would initially
hold on to a majority of the business  which will need increased
investments in coming years  but would not commit to how much it might
want to float or when   We want to control it  to direct it   Chief
Executive Joe Kaeser told Bloomberg TV  The move  which follows a
carve out of the business from the rest of the group  takes Siemens in
a different direction from global rivals  General Electric   N GE  and
Philips  AS PHG   who are doubling down on healthcare as they shed
financial services and lighting respectively   The news overshadowed a
cautious outlook for the current fiscal year and a large drop in
fourth quarter orders  lifting Siemens shares 3 6 percent to a two
month high  outperforming a 1 3 percent rise in the German blue chip
DAX  GDAXI    Sentiment could be helped by the announced Healthcare
listing   UBS analysts wrote in a note  calling fourth quarter profits
in line  orders weak and 2017 guidance below expectations  They kept
their  neutral  recommendation  Siemens has in past decades carried
out partial listings  spin offs  joint ventures and outright sales of
its units as it exited the semiconductor  lighting  automotive and
communications businesses  among others  Siemens said it expected a
modest rise of 1 2 percent in sales in its current fiscal year to end
September  and for orders to outpace revenues  provided that the
market environment for high margin  short cycle businesses stabilizes
For Siemens  that means its industrial software unit Digital Factory
its most profitable unit excluding Healthineers  Oil and gas dependent
Process Industries and Drives  its other short cycle business  was the
only unit to miss its profit target in the quarter  SILVER LINING
Current geopolitical developments require our attention to a
particularly high degree   Kaeser told a news conference at the group
s Munich headquarters   We continue to anticipate headwinds for
macroeconomic growth and investment sentiment in our markets   Kaeser
said  however  that the shock victory of Donald Trump in the U S
presidential election could have a silver lining for Siemens  given
Trump s campaign promises to rebuild infrastructure and despite his
anti globalization rhetoric  Siemens makes  22 billion or a quarter of
its revenue in the United States   Give him a chance  let s see what
we can do together and take the positive out of it   Kaeser said in an
interview on Bloomberg TV  For its fourth quarter  Siemens reported an
18 percent rise in net income to 1 18 billion euros   1 29 billion
in line with expectations  and flat industrial business profit of 2 45
billion euros that beat the average estimate of 2 41 billion euros in
a Reuters poll   But a 13 percent drop in order intake to 20 3 billion
euros   which Siemens put down to a tough comparison with the year ago
period when it won large contracts including a German wind power deal
fell short of the 21 4 billion euros poll average",2016-11-10,Reuters
204,U S  stocks not moved by October s marquee deals,"By Lauren Hirsch and Noel Randewich  Reuters    The record dealmaking
volume for October did not create a ripple effect lifting U S  stocks
as it has in the past   partly because the mergers  albeit large  were
few and far between  bankers and analysts said  Though acquisitive
corporate bosses generated  329 billion worth of takeovers in October
the biggest month for U S  M A on record  according to Thomson Reuters
data  the 615 deals that were announced marked the lowest number of
monthly deals since March  2013  The top four deals alone represented
over one half the month s total  The sparsity of deals indicates that
while confidence may be running high in board rooms at a handful of
large companies  it is not necessarily widespread across corporate
America  As such  the stock market s 1 9 percent drop in October  as
measured by the S P 500 index  was more of a thud than a rallying roar
It should be bullish  because it s a sign that companies see value in
other companies  but it hasn t helped   said Donald Selkin  chief
market strategist at National Securities in New York   People feel
that there s not as much value in these stocks as there might have
been   The deals also lack a common or new motivation that would
inspire investors to gobble up stocks in anticipation of more mergers
bankers said  While there is some ambition to get transactions done
before the U S  Federal Reserve makes financing more expensive by
raising interest rates  people involved with M A say that was not a
primary factor in October  The presidential election  just over a week
away  also did not appear to be a driver  But the autumn merger boom
does reflect a less alluring reality  the summer was uncertain as CEOs
put off deals they might have done sooner  Third quarter M A in the U
S  accounted for just 24 percent of total year to date M A  the lowest
percentage since 2007   Britain s Brexit vote in June to leave the
European Union kicked off a spate of market volatility  Although
Brexit fueled some deals in October because the British pound had lost
so much value  it stymied activity until recently   In the summer  the
dealmakers in the U S  took a collective breather   said John Reiss
global head of M A at law firm White   Case  DEALS ACROSS THE BOARD
October s megadeals were spread out among many sectors  The biggest
for the month  as well as 2016 to date  was telecom giant AT T  NYSE T
Inc s proposed  85 4 billion acquisition of content creator  Time
Warner  Inc  NYSE TWX   Qualcomm s  38 billion purchase of  NXP
Semiconductors  NV  NASDAQ NXPI  also set a record for the
semiconductor sector  There were also large deals announced between
cigarette makers  asset managers  and oil and gas producers
Healthcare stood out as a sector without big deals  All told  there
were 10 deals larger than  5 billion in October  and the average deal
size was  535 million   the highest since July 2015  when it was  329
million   Bankers  lawyers and executives involved with the October
flurry described a range of rationales  For instance  British American
Tobacco s  47 billion offer to buy U S  tobacco firm Reynolds American
Inc  NYSE RAI  was driven by the drop in sterling   General Electric
NYSE GE  Co s decision to merge its oil and gas business with Baker
Hughes Inc reflects its ongoing divestiture of peripheral businesses
And while the AT T Time Warner tie up happened in October  it was
driven by a years long disruption in technology  media and telecom
businesses that has led those types of companies to combine   At the
end of the summer  there were a lot of things going on in the world
there was discussion around interest rates  concern over Brexit
uncertainty over where the economy was headed   said Steve Arcano  who
concentrates on M A as a partner at law firm Skadden  Arps  Slate

Washington and Havana make it hard for U S  companies to do business
in Cuba despite a detente between the U S  and Cuban governments
according to American executives in Havana for an annual trade fair
this week  Many vowed to keep trying  though  as reconciliation
between the former Cold War foes slowly opens the door to a new market
In the build up to the fair  representatives from 25 U S  companies
spoke about opportunities on the Communist ruled island as they
gathered at the former U S  Businessmen s Club in Old Havana  It was a
symbolic location  in a building taken over by Fidel Castro s
revolutionary government after the overthrow of a U S  backed
dictatorship in 1959  A U S  hotel  cruise ships and commercial
flights have appeared in Cuba for the first time in more than 50 years
since U S  President Barack Obama and his Cuban counterpart  Raul
Castro  announced in 2014 that they would work toward normalizing
relations  But while Obama has loosened the U S  trade embargo on Cuba
the Republican controlled U S  Congress has not heeded his calls to
end it  Together with Cuba s bureaucracy and ongoing allergy to
capitalism  that means serious opportunities on the large island close
to Florida remain a struggle for most U S  companies   We are seeking
a blanket license from the U S  Treasury Department for all our
products  We have been waiting a while already  something like 10
months   said Hector Rodriguez  sales manager at Puerto Rico company
Rimco  the official dealer for Caterpillar s  N CAT  Cuba business and
one of the trade fair s exhibitors   Progress has been made in areas
such as civil aviation and telecommunications  but not others such as
infrastructure  energy and health  said Myron Brilliant  executive
vice president of the U S  Chamber of Commerce  which represents many
at the fair and hosted the meeting at the old downtown business club
There has been significant  historic progress on the political front
while on the commercial  only incremental progress   said Brilliant
whose group represents corporations eying or already in Cuba
including American Airlines  O AAL    Dow Chemical  Co  N DOW    Fifth
Street Asset Management   O FSAM   First Data Corp   N FDC  and
General Electric  Co  N GE    Cuba has not been a country that has
encouraged foreign investment  profitability  entrepreneurship and
innovation  and these remain sensitive cultural issues   Brilliant
said  voicing frustration that more deals had not been signed and
admiration that so many of his members took a long view and remained
interested in Cuba  Hundreds of U S  companies and their legal
counsels have met Cuban officials over the last year to discuss trade
and investment  often accompanying local  state and national
politicians Some companies have lost interest  but many remain in
contact with Cuban officials   You are trying to undo 55 years of
enmity and that requires patience   said Pedro Freyre  chair of
international practice at Akerman LLP  and who travels frequently to
Havana  adding that some clients became frustrated  but most
understood     That you can use your cell phone in Cuba  that you can
catch a flight out of New York or Ft  Lauderdale  that Cuban
programmers are doing work for U S  companies  that a cruise ship
regularly docks here  that is remarkable   he said",2016-11-02,Reuters

stealth jets and the buzz of plans to build commercial jumbos  China
in the past week offered a quiet first peek at a key test of its drive
to become a global aviation powerhouse   a giant state owned aero
engine maker  In an unassuming pavilion the size of a large gym
tucked behind the main exhibition halls of the Airshow China expo that
closes on Sunday  Aero Engine Corp of China  AECC  was on public
display for the first time  Beijing launched the firm in August in a
multi billion dollar mission to develop home grown  high tech products
fit for export  For all the grand vision  no new technology was on
display at the 1 200 square meter pavilion  That was no surprise to
Western industry experts  while China has so far grown more in scale
and speed its in aviation drive than some expected  the proprietary
commercial engines that are the pinnacle of aero development will take
at least a decade to develop  they say   Designing an entire engine
and designing the entire infrastructure around it so that you can
develop it and maintain it  that is the big issue   said Jorg Schluter
a senior engineering lecturer at Australia s Deakin University   The
AECC s presence at the show in Zhuhai  China s biggest air expo  was
far from discreet  with banners on the highway to the event site
emblazoned with its blue and white logo  Still  an AECC official at
the site told Reuters that the firm was not giving interviews nor
holding events at AirShow China   Engine mock ups  gas turbines whose
design dates back to 2002 and an interactive science exhibition
offered little more than a rough sketch of a company with a nearly 100
000 strong workforce  Drawn together in a union of more than 20 engine
companies  repair sites and institutes scattered around the country
AECC s origins date back to the Mao era  What the company has to its
advantage  analysts concede  is cash and a fast growing domestic
airline market  The new firm was seeded with registered capital of 50
billion yuan   7 40 billion  from the State Council  the Beijing
government  as well as state owned planemakers   ZERO PRESENCE  BIG
RIVALS Beijing s efforts to transform state owned businesses have
reached into sectors such as steel and shipping  But it has no major
presence in the commercial engine sector  dominated by  General

Rolls Royce  L RR     If you want to break into the world it s a very
difficult thing to do and the incumbents aren t going to make it easy
said Mark Daly  editor of IHS Jane s Aero Engines  China s first home
built passenger jets  the ARJ 21 and C919  currently use foreign made
engines   To date  China s experience is largely limited to warplane
engines  mostly in cooperation with or on license from Russia  but
analysts say it is struggling to develop ones that will match Western
fighters in combat   While the country has made great strides in high
speed rail and nuclear technology by acquiring the know how from
overseas partners or reverse engineering products  it has found it
more difficult to break into the secretive engine sector  whose
technology is heavily guarded by governments and original equipment
manufacturers  OEM   These OEMs have found ways over the past decade
to restrict reverse engineering of their engines  through means such
as tighter control of their spare parts supply chain  said Steffen

210,ABB rejects shareholder calls to spin off Power Grids,"By John Revill ZURICH  Reuters    Swiss engineering group ABB  S ABBN
is to keep its Power Grids business in a rejection of demands from an
activist investor to spin it off and is to start a  3 billion share
buy back from next year  The Zurich based company s long awaited
decision disappointed Cevian Capital  ABB s second biggest shareholder
which had wanted Power Grids to become a separate entity  Investor AB
ABB s largest shareholder  backed the decision to hold on to Power
Grids  ABB said on Tuesday it had made this choice to take advantage
of trends like smart grids and linking renewable energy production to
consumers and that this was a better option than selling  floating  or
spinning off the business  Cevian Capital  ABB s second biggest
shareholder with a 6 2 percent stake  said it was disappointed   ABB
is a collection of top quality businesses whose performance has been
hindered for many years by the company s conglomerate structure
Christer Gardell  Cevian s Managing Partner   co founder  said  Cevian
said that separating ABB and Power Grids  which makes parts for
offshore wind turbines  could create two companies with combined share
price of 35 Swiss francs   35 80    The board has decided to keep the
conglomerate structure  We think this is an unfortunate decision  The
board and management team will be held accountable for realizing 35
francs   Gardell said  ABB s share price  which despite a recovery in
2016  has lagged rivals like  General Electric   N GE    Siemens   DE
SIEGn  and  Legrand   PA LEGD  over the past five years  ABB s shares
were up about 1 5 percent at 22 31 Swiss francs at 0857 GMT  ABB Chief
Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer said he had had a  friendly and open
conversation with Cevian early on Tuesday  without giving further
details   Cevian and ABB have a lot in common   he told reporters   We
will drive a lot of value creation for our shareholders   Chief
Financial Officer Erik Elzvik said it would be possible for ABB to
increase its share price to 35 Swiss francs  but did not give a time
frame  Power Grids is the least profitable of ABB s divisions due
partly to its involvement low margin projects  Competition has also
forced down prices of products like transformers  also hitting margins
Profitability has improved this year as a result of linking with
partners to share the risk on projects and a greater focus on product
supply rather than engineering  procurement and construction
management services  ABB said it was raising its margin outlook for
Power Grids to a range of 10 to 14 percent from 2018  from a previous
target of 8 to 12 percent  This would be achieved by focusing on
higher margin consultancy services and software  Spiesshofer said he
saw potential because the power grids market was growing at around 3
percent per year  but some parts were growing much faster   Investor
AB CEO Johan Forssell said   We see no reason to jeopardize the strong
momentum  for example when it comes to cost savings and the turnaround
of the systems part of Power Grids  the company enjoys by breaking it
up    Secondly  we believe that ABB is more worth kept together than
divided into pieces  We simply believe that the separation costs
outweigh the positive aspects of a breakup  and we believe that ABB is
a good owner of the business   ABB  which announced its plans at an
investor day on Tuesday  said the share buy back program would run
from 2017 2019     1   0 9776 Swiss francs",2016-10-04,Reuters
211,GE cuts year revenue target on oil  gas weakness  has third quarter profit beat,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK  Reuters     General Electric  Co  N GE
scaled back expectations for its full year revenue and profit on
Friday  overshadowing third quarter profit that beat analyst forecasts
and sending its shares lower   Weak global economies and low oil
prices hit the industrial giant s sales of oil and gas infrastructure
equipment especially hard  This limited GE s organic revenue growth
which excludes acquisitions  to just 1 percent in the quarter  The
company s shares were down 0 9 percent at  28 81 in afternoon trading
on the New York Stock Exchange  Earlier the stock fell 2 percent  the
biggest decliner in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index  On the
plus side  GE s adjusted quarterly profit jumped 10 percent to 32
cents a share  exceeding the 30 cents that analysts had estimated on
average  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S   Analysts said the beat
was not a complete surprise since they had recently trimmed estimates
by two or three cents  GE also raised its full year target for cash
returned to shareholders to  30 billion from  26 billion and noted it
had returned  25 billion in the first three quarters   The company
lifted its cash flow outlook to at least  32 billion  up from a range
of  29 billion to  32 billion it forecast at the end of the second
quarter  FORECASTS ADJUSTED But GE trimmed its full year revenue
forecast to flat to 2 percent growth  down from 2 percent to 4 percent
growth   It also narrowed its adjusted profit forecast to between  1
48 and  1 52 a share  compared with the  1 45 to  1 55 a share
forecast at the end of the second quarter   GE s weak revenue largely
reflected the continuing reluctance of oil and gas companies to make
new long term investments  despite signs that the market is picking up
GE officials said   GE s oil and gas segment revenue slumped 25
percent in the quarter  disappointing analysts  who had been hoping GE
would report stronger revenue growth after a weak first half  Three
big international oil and gas deals that GE had expected to close in
the second half have been delayed or suspended  so GE cut them from
its projections for the year  Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein
told Reuters   Bornstein said he thought the oil and gas market had
bottomed during the summer and there were clear signs of growth in rig
counts and other measures in North America  But sales of GE s large
equipment would take longer to improve   We believe it ll begin to
turn in 2017   he said   The speed with which that happens I don t
exactly know   Investors had been skeptical that GE s organic revenue
growth could hit analysts  estimates of about 5 percent in the fourth
quarter  Sanford C Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker wrote in a note
Now  the anemic third quarter growth  again calls into question the
company s ability to hit the 5 percent  target  he said  While
strength in GE s healthcare  aviation and renewable energy businesses
helped   there is not going be the significant turnaround in the
second half that was originally anticipated   said Jeff Windau  an
analyst at Edward Jones in St  Louis   Still  cost cutting in oil and
gas and other businesses and a diminishing drag from foreign exchange
translation should allow GE to deliver  2 a share in adjusted earnings

212,Obama vetoes Sept  11 Saudi bill  sets up showdown with Congress,"By Patricia Zengerle and Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON  Reuters
President Barack Obama on Friday vetoed legislation allowing families
of victims of the Sept  11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia  which could
prompt Congress to overturn his decision with a rare veto override
the first of his presidency  Obama said the Justice Against Sponsors
of Terrorism Act would hurt U S  national security and harm important
alliances  while shifting crucial terrorism related issues from policy
officials into the hands of the courts  The bill passed the Senate and
House of Representatives in reaction to long running suspicions
denied by Saudi Arabia  that hijackers of the four U S  jetliners that
attacked the United States in 2001 were backed by the Saudi government
Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals  Obama said other
countries could use the law  known as JASTA  as an excuse to sue U S
diplomats  members of the military or companies   even for actions of
foreign organizations that had received U S  aid  equipment or
training   Removing sovereign immunity in U S  courts from foreign
governments that are not designated as state sponsors of terrorism
based solely on allegations that such foreign governments  actions
abroad had a connection to terrorism related injuries on U S  soil
threatens to undermine these longstanding principles that protect the
United States  our forces  and our personnel   Obama said in a
statement  Senator Chuck Schumer  who co wrote the legislation and has
championed it  immediately made clear how difficult it will be for
Obama to sustain the veto  Schumer  the No  3 Democrat in the Senate
issued a statement within moments of receiving the veto  promising
that it would be  swiftly and soundly overturned   He represents New
York  home of most of the Sept  11 victims  Both the Democratic and
Republican candidates for president  Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
said they would have signed the bill into law if they were in the
White House  SOME DOUBTS  If two thirds of the lawmakers in both the
Senate and House vote to override  the law would stand  the first such
override since he became president in 2009  and possibly the last
Obama leaves office in January  Friday s veto was the twelfth of his
presidency  An override has been expected  despite some lawmakers
saying they had doubts about the measure  In a letter seen by Reuters
on Friday  Republican Representative Mac Thornberry  chairman of the
powerful House Armed Services Committee  said he would oppose the
override   My primary concern is that this bill increases the risk
posed to American military and intelligence personnel  diplomats and
others serving our country around the world   Thornberry wrote in a
letter encouraging his fellow Republicans to sustain the veto  House
Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday he thought there were enough votes to
override a veto  but had concerns   I worry about trial lawyers trying
to get rich off of this  And I do worry about the precedent   he told
reporters  The  9 11 Families   Survivors United for Justice Against
Terrorism  group  which has pressed Congress to uphold the legislation
called Obama s veto explanation  unconvincing and unsupportable   The
Saudi government has lobbied heavily to stop the bill  the European
Union has formally opposed it and Gulf States have condemned it  Major
U S  corporations such as  General Electric   NYSE GE  and  Dow
Chemical   NYSE DOW  have also pressed lawmakers to reconsider    The
bill is not balanced  sets a dangerous precedent  and has real
potential to destabilize vital bilateral relationships and the global
economy   GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt said in a letter to Senate
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  who supports the bill",2016-09-23,Reuters
213, Re Polonisation  puts banks under government scrutiny,"By Marcin Goclowski WARSAW  Reuters    Poland s conservative Law and
Justice  PiS  government has set out to buy bank stakes back from
foreign investors  a move some bankers and economists say will hamper
lenders that prospered through the global financial crisis   Last
Wednesday  state run  Alior Bank   WA ALRR  and PKO BP  WA PKO
confirmed they are in talks to buy Raiffeisen s banking and leasing
arms respectively  The government has already bought back GE Money s
N GE  Polish arm this year and plans to buy the second largest lender
Pekao  WA PEO  from UniCredit  MI CRDI   The state owns two other
banks outright  controls majority stakes in a further two and has a 30
percent plus stake in the biggest bank  PKO   Poles played a leading
role in the 1980s in ending communist rule in eastern Europe  Some now
fear banks owned partly by the government would boost lending to
projects such as coal mines or large infrastructure projects that
might create jobs but not profits in an economy long viewed as a
showcase for democracy   I m not a supporter of turning re
Polonisation into nationalisation   said Cezary Stypulkowski  the
chief executive of Poland s No 4 lender mBank  WA MBK   advocating
domestication  of management instead to ensure credit reaches local
companies   It is very easy to manage the banking sector by political
structures  In such cases  a tendency to circumvent the rules
typically ends in disaster   PiS chairman and former Polish prime
minister Jaros aw Kaczy ski told supporters in 2012   It must be made
clear     that our goal is a re Polonisation of Polish banks   PiS
which came to power last year  pledged to introduce new taxes for
banks and supermarkets  cut the retirement age and boost state
payments for children   It also wanted to help homeowners who borrowed
in foreign currency when exchange rates were favorable by converting
the debts into Polish zlotys at the original rate  a promise the state
has yet to fully meet  POLITICAL WILL But its plans for banks could
prove most controversial    There s a political will to conduct re
Polonisation   said one senior official   It was decided  politically
that there s too much foreign capital in the banking sector   If the
government succeeds in its strategy  the state and other Polish
investors  including one of its richest men  Leszek Czarnecki  will
control banks with 54 percent of Poland s banking assets  including
mortgages and loans  That will displace foreign investors who now
control the majority of such assets  Officials familiar with
government thinking told Reuters that it is motivated  in part  by a
desire to prevent banks from choking off credit to the economy to
preserve large shareholder dividends   The issue is to make sure no
one turns off the tap when a crisis occurs  like in 2009   one of
those people said  Some managers have publicly supported such a stance
We prefer to credit the economy than pay out a dividend   Zbigniew
Jagiello  chief executive of top bank PKO BP  WA PKO   recently told
Poland s PAP state news agency  adding that he hoped to do both  PKO
is a state controlled entity  The government in Warsaw has also played
down any risk of political interference   After possible re
Polonisation  the government s impact on banks will be rather small
said Rafal Bochenek  a spokesman for the government  But others are
skeptical   I haven t seen any research confirming that international
banking groups overestimate the risk in crisis times   said Jakub
Borowski  chief economist at  Credit Agricole   PA CAGR  in Warsaw
We are dealing with an expression of faith that has not been confirmed
by empirical studies yet   Krzysztof Pietraszkiewicz  head of Polish
banking lobby group ZBP  said that while he supports some increase in
state ownership in the sector  he hoped it would not lead to lending
for loss making projects or generous loan restructuring   One should
avoid the situation where public opinion forces politicians to act in
a way that poses a threat for the financial sector   he said  The
Polish government is examining its next steps   It could  via state
owned Alior Bank  buy Raiffeisen s Polish unit  as well as Pekao  via
state run insurer PZU  from UniCredit  Raiffeinsen is worth around 1
billion euros  The value of UniCredit s 40 percent stake in Pekao is
worth roughly  3 5 billion  But Credit Agricole s Borowski questions
what is more beneficial for long term economic growth and welfare  Can
we spend these billions of zlotys more productively than parking them
in banks",2016-09-26,Reuters
214,Congress rejects Obama veto  Saudi September 11 bill becomes law,"By Patricia Zengerle WASHINGTON  Reuters    Congress on Wednesday
overwhelmingly rejected President Barack Obama s veto of legislation
allowing relatives of the victims of the Sept  11 attacks to sue Saudi
Arabia  the first veto override of his presidency  just four months
before it ends  The House of Representatives voted 348 77 against the
veto  hours after the Senate rejected it 97 1  meaning the  Justice
Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act  will become law  The vote was a
blow to Obama as well as to Saudi Arabia  one of the United States
longest standing allies in the Arab world  and some lawmakers who
supported the override already plan to revisit the issue  Obama said
he thought the Congress had made a mistake  reiterating his belief
that the legislation set a dangerous precedent and indicating that he
thought political considerations were behind the vote   If you re
perceived as voting against 9 11 families right before an election
not surprisingly  that s a hard vote for people to take  But it would
have been the right thing to do   he said on CNN  Obama s 11 previous
vetoes were all sustained  But this time almost all his strongest
Democratic supporters in Congress joined Republicans to oppose him in
one of their last actions before leaving Washington to campaign for
the Nov  8 election   Overriding a presidential veto is something we
don t take lightly  but it was important in this case that the
families of the victims of 9 11 be allowed to pursue justice  even if
that pursuit causes some diplomatic discomforts   Senator Charles
Schumer  a top Senate Democrat  said in a statement  Schumer
represents New York  site of the World Trade Center and home to many
of the nearly 3 000 people killed in the 2001 attacks  survivors and
families of victims  The law  known as JASTA  passed the House and
Senate without objections earlier this year  Support was fueled by
impatience in Congress with Saudi Arabia over its human rights record
promotion of a severe form of Islam tied to militancy and failure to
do more to ease the international refugee crisis  The law grants an
exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of
terrorism on U S  soil  clearing the way for lawsuits seeking damages
from the Saudi government  Riyadh has denied longstanding suspicions
that it backed the hijackers who attacked the United States in 2001
Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals  Family members had
tied their last push for the bill to the 15th anniversary of the
attacks this month  demonstrating outside the White House and Capitol
On Wednesday  two fire trucks displayed a giant U S  flag outside the
Senate   We rejoice in this triumph and look forward to our day in
court and a time when we may finally get more answers regarding who
was truly behind the attacks   Terry Strada  whose husband died in the
attacks  said in a statement  RISK TO TROOPS  Obama argued that JASTA
could expose U S  companies  troops and officials to lawsuits if other
countries passed reciprocal legislation  and may anger important
allies  He called Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and wrote a letter
to him explaining that he strongly believed enacting JASTA into law
would be detrimental to U S  interests  Reid became the only senator
to side with Obama  Some lawmakers said the White House  which has a
history of poor relations with Congress  had waited too long to fight
the bill  The Sept  11 families have received more than  7 billion
but bill backers said their intention was to allow lawsuits to punish
any government that backs terrorism on U S  soil   This bill was

215,Japan conglomerates seek to merge loss making nuclear fuel operations  sources,"By Makiko Yamazaki and Kentaro Hamada TOKYO  Reuters    Three Japanese
conglomerates are in talks to combine their loss making domestic
nuclear fuel operations  people with direct knowledge of the matter
said  as the outlook for restarts of reactors following the Fukushima
nuclear crisis remains bleak  Hitachi Ltd  T 6501   Toshiba Corp  T
6502  and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd  T 7011  aim to merge the
operations as early as spring 2017  one of the people said  declining
to be identified as the discussions were confidential  The person
added that the three companies may eventually consider merging their
nuclear reactor businesses  although nothing specific has been
discussed so far  Only three of Japan s 42 reactors are currently
operating after they were idled in the wake of the 2011 earthquake and
tsunami that destroyed Tokyo Electric Power Co s  T 9501  Fukushima
Daiichi power station  Public opposition  safety and other regulatory
obstacles has made the outlook for further restarts extremely unclear
The move has also likely been encouraged by General Electric s  N GE
growing interest in the market for fuel for pressurized water reactors
PWRs   said an executive at a Japanese utility  GE has a controlling
stake in a joint venture with Hitachi and Toshiba called Global
Nuclear Fuel  which provides fuel for boiling water reactors  BWRs
The traditional dividing line in the U S  nuclear industry with GE
specializing in fuel for BWRs and Toshiba s Westinghouse focusing on
fuel for PWRs is no longer applicable  he said   The merger of Japan s
nuclear fuel businesses will to a large extent take its cues from GE
said the executive  declining to be identified as he was not part of
the discussions  PWRs have been growing in popularity  particularly in
emerging economies like China  As of December 2015  PWRs accounted for
more than 80 percent of 66 nuclear reactors under construction  The
three Japanese conglomerates are aiming to reach a preliminary
agreement by the end of the year  the person with direct knowledge of
the matter said  The companies said they were considering options for
their domestic nuclear fuel businesses but no decisions had been made
The conglomerates are likely to first form a joint holding company for
their fuel businesses before merging them into one entity  the Nikkei
business daily reported  Industry sources said the government has been
pushing the firms to integrate their fuel businesses  raising the
chances that any merger plan will not run into any anti trust issues
Until the Fukushima disaster  the nuclear fuel business had been a
stable source of profits for the domestic nuclear power industry
Toshiba  which has overseas nuclear fuel operations through its U S
unit Westinghouse  forecasts that fuel will generate 17 percent of the
estimated 870 billion yen   8 56 billion  in revenue from its nuclear
power business for this financial year   Hitachi has a global nuclear
power alliance with  General Electric  Co  N GE  while Mitsubishi
Heavy has one with France s  Areva  SA  PA AREVA    Hitachi s shares
gained 2 4 percent and Mitsubishi Heavy advanced 2 3 percent on

216,Suing governments over terror no sure thing despite U S  September 11 law,"By Mica Rosenberg NEW YORK  Reuters    Families of Sept  11 victims
and others who may seek to sue foreign governments accused of
supporting terrorism in the United States still face significant legal
hurdles  despite a boost from passage of a law allowing such cases to
proceed   The new Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act  or JASTA
grants an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in
cases of terrorism on U S  soil   Passage of the law over a
presidential veto could allow relatives and survivors of the Sept  11
2001 attacks to move forward with a case they filed more than a decade
ago against Saudi Arabia in New York federal court  Still  it will be
hard to prove a foreign nation is responsible for acts of terrorism
said attorneys and professors with expertise in international law  who
expected drawn out legal wrangling   We may find that at the end of
the day  after years of litigation  that the link is not sufficiently
established even for Saudi Arabia   said Curtis Bradley  a law
professor at Duke University   The law says plaintiffs must show the
foreign state  knowingly or recklessly provided material support or
resources  to designated terrorist groups  not that the countries were
simply negligent or looked the other way   Congress on Wednesday
overwhelming voted to pass the law  overturning President Barack Obama
s veto  Before the law  American victims of terrorist acts could only
sue countries designated by the U S  State Department as state
sponsors of terrorism  currently Iran  Syria and Sudan  Now  any
country can be sued if there are allegations of support for known
terrorists that carry out attacks on U S  soil   Existing tort law
requires plaintiffs to prove that support played a  substantial factor
in the victims  injuries  a high bar  said Jimmy Gurule an expert in
international criminal law at the University of Notre Dame   This
could be challenging in the Sept  11 case since an independent
commission on the 2001 attacks did not find sufficient evidence of
Saudi involvement  Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attacks and
most of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals    We have a high degree
of confidence we can meet that burden  The Saudis think we can t
said Jack Quinn  co counsel for more than 2 000 family members of Sept
11 victims   The families sued Saudi Arabia in 2003  seeking to hold
the country responsible  The proceedings have been stalled on the
question of Saudi Arabia s immunity Quinn said the plaintiffs will now
ask the 2nd U S  Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider the issue in
light of the new law   If the court says the case can move forward
both sides will use discovery to seek documents and take depositions
of witnesses and experts    We will next attempt to complete the
development of evidence and find out what the truth is and on the
basis of that  let the chips fall as they may   said Quinn   LONG
BATTLE AHEAD But even under the new law  the White House can still
request a court to halt this and other potential lawsuits  The law
allows a court to put a proceeding against a foreign state on hold if
the United States says it  is engaged in good faith discussions  with
the country to resolve the claims   The stay provision and other
changes were added to address concerns raised by the White House
Saudi Arabia and companies like  General Electric   NYSE GE  and  Dow
Chemical   NYSE DOW  Co  Obama is likely to request such a stay  said
Bradley  Stephen Vladeck of the University of Texas School of Law
said this revision and others injected uncertainty into the law and
could result in litigation aimed at clarifying the bill s language
The next step in this is either a whole bunch of lawsuits being placed
on indefinite hold or a whole bunch of litigation to figure out the
meaning of all these obstacles that Congress snuck back into the bill
at the last minute   said Vladeck  Even with the revisions  detractors
of the new law worried that it could inspire other countries to
retaliate by enacting their own statutes that could drag the United
States or U S  companies into court  Some U S  lawmakers said Congress
may revisit the law to narrow it further   Ultimately  though  if the
victims of terrorist acts win a court judgment against a foreign
government  other cases have shown that collecting damages can be a
slog  A Reuters analysis last year found that in the 10 years
following the Sept  11 attacks  the number of lawsuits filed under the
U S  Anti Terrorism Act and similar laws more than tripled compared to
the decade before with plaintiffs winning billions of dollars worth of
judgments in U S  courts   But judgments awarded against organizations
or governments are often unenforceable and even when there are assets
that can be claimed in the United States  their value often falls
short of the award",2016-09-30,Reuters
217,Sensing threat  UPS plans to expand its 3D printing operations,"By Nick Carey LOUISVILLE  Ky   Reuters     United Parcel  Service
NYSE UPS  plans to expand its 3D printing service to Asia and Europe
the U S  shipping company has told Reuters  in a bid to fully embrace
and get ahead of a trend that threatens to eat away a small but
lucrative part of its business   Aside from its main package delivery
service  UPS gets an undisclosed portion of its revenue from storing
and shipping parts for manufacturers  If those customers were to
switch to 3D printing their own parts  that business would face a
drastic reduction  To counter that threat  UPS has chosen to get on
board the 3D revolution  and is now looking to offer a service in
which UPS will print out plastic parts   anything from nozzles to
brackets to prototype soap dispensers or multi faceted moving parts
around the world and deliver them   3D printing is a great opportunity
for us  but it s also a threat   Alan Amling  UPS vice president for
corporate strategy  told Reuters  The dynamic   welcoming rather than
fighting a threatening new technology   is not unlike automakers such
as Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  AG teaming up with
ride hailing services Uber and Gett  respectively  Amling said UPS is
looking at either Singapore or Japan for an Asian 3D printing factory
He did not say where the company might open a European facility
though UPS s operational hub in Europe is in Cologne  Germany  UPS has
already got into the business in its home market  In May  it launched
a U S  based 3D printing service with Fast Radius  a 3D printing
company based outside Atlanta  where UPS is headquartered  UPS bought
an unspecified stake in Fast Radius  which has a 3D printing factory
at UPS s Louisville  Kentucky  hub   There are also now 3D printers at
60 UPS stores in the United States that print parts using industrial
grade thermoplastics  Customers can upload images for printing at the
Fast Radius factory or at one of those UPS stores and have the printed
products shipped to any location  HOW IT WORKS A 3D printer works by
laying down successive levels of material  mostly plastics at this
point  to create an object  Quality printers that make metal parts
cost over  500 000  while printers that use thermoplastics can cost
tens of thousands of dollars  Prices are expected to come down as the
technology advances  While 3D printing is still slow compared to high
speed production lines  the technology has progressed so it can be
used effectively for prototypes or some components that are not needed
in high volumes  Larger firms such as  General Electric   NYSE GE  Co
are incorporating 3D printed parts into production  That progress is a
mixed blessing for UPS  As the cost of 3D printers drops and processes
improve  that could undermine UPS s efforts to develop 3D printing as
a service   because customers could buy just buy their own printers
Why wait a day for a part to arrive  from UPS  when you ll be able to
innovate six times a day on your own   said Richard D Aveni  a
professor of strategy at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth
College  A QUIET CORNER What Fast Radius calls its  digital
manufacturing factory  is a quiet operation occupying space in a
corner of the UPS building in Louisville  without any of the grime
noise or bustle associated with a standard factory   Instead  a
handful of machines work noiselessly  printing parts of varying sizes
and shapes  During a recent visit to the operation by Reuters  Fast
Radius CEO Rick Smith said that because of 3D printing  manufacturing
is about to transform from  being about where it s made to where it s
needed    One of the printers was close to completing a black plastic
prototype hydraulic pump for a manufacturing customer in Germany   a
process that takes about 72 hours  Smith said the job illustrates the
need for UPS to expand its service beyond the United States   Another
customer  action camera maker GoPro Inc  is making use of Fast Radius
printers  coupled with UPS s ability to deliver a prototype the next
day  Previously  if GoPro wanted to try out new designs  it would take
weeks or even months to make a mock up  senior GoPro product designer
Ryan Harrison said  Now the company can innovate much quicker   3D
printing allows you to fail quicker or to stumble on moments of genius
Harrison said   BRACING FOR DISRUPTION  UPS does not break out how
much it makes from its supply chain services  including warehouse
storage  But in 2015 it reported about  6 billion in  forwarding and
logistics  revenue  or about 10 percent of its total sales  An unknown
portion of that came from its warehousing operations  UPS s biggest
rival  FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX   is less focused on supply chain services
and has not dipped into 3D printing  But if UPS succeeds  analysts
said  FedEx could follow suit  The company declined to comment on 3D
printing   German competitor DHL  a unit of  Deutsche Post  AG  DE
DPWGn   issued a report earlier this year warning the technology could
upend traditional mass production manufacturing  in which goods are
shipped around the world   UPS s foray into 3D printing is not its
first experiment in other disruptive industries  In October 2015  it
invested in drone maker CyPhy Works  and this February bought a stake
in same day delivery company Deliv   in both instances to understand
and harness potentially industry shaking technologies   Morningstar
analyst Keith Schoonmaker said while 3D printing has not yet proved
itself on a mass scale  it makes sense for UPS to incorporate a
technology  that could supplement or replace its services",2016-09-16,Reuters
218,Europe s biggest software maker SAP ditches annual reviews,"By Harro Ten Wolde and Ilona Wissenbach FRANKFURT  Reuters    Germany
s SAP  DE SAPG   maker of software used to grade the performance of
millions of employees worldwide  is ditching its own annual
performance reviews as too expensive  time consuming and often
demotivating  Once championed by business leaders as the key to better
productivity  annual appraisals are falling out of fashion with
companies including  IBM   N IBM   Gap  N GPS  and even  General
Electric   N GE   whose long time Chief Executive Jack Welch is
credited with popularising the system  SAP  which for the last two
years has had an American CEO and employs almost a third of its staff
in the United States  is one of the first major European companies to
join the trend that began across the Atlantic  The ritual of the
annual performance review is widely disliked by employees  SAP s human
resources head for Germany  Wolfgang Fassnacht  said Europe s biggest
software maker had found the annual review process  with its focus on
separating over  from under performers  was often counter productive
to the goal of constructive dialogue   Grading workers did not work
People are open to feedback  also to harsh criticism  until the moment
you start giving scores  Then the shutters go down   he told Reuters
SAP is testing a new process  which includes more regular check in
talks  on about 8 000 of its workers and aims to implement it for all
of its almost 80 000 workforce next year   The old system is too
static   said Fassnacht   It no longer reflects the dynamic
circumstances we are operating in   HOT TOPIC SAP is a world leader in
human resources  HR  software and made a big bet on performance
management tools with the  3 4 billion acquisition of U S  cloud
computing company successfactors com in 2012  It gets a lot of
feedback from its customers  Fassnacht said  a factor that may have
influenced its decision to ditch the dreaded annual review    I meet
many HR managers at other companies  The topic is on everyone s mind
at the moment   he said   This is actually one of the hottest topics
discussed in the HR area   SAP is not putting itself out of business
however  It will continue to sell its performance assessment software
and it announced in February it would also introduce software for
continuous performance management of employees  Although many
companies are re assessing the annual review  Sydney based management
consultancy Strategic Factors  a specialist in strategic planning and
performance measurement  warned against ditching employee reviews
wholesale   Regular check ins are great  this ongoing conversation and
coaching model  but we also need performance measurements  We need to
be careful to not chuck out the baby with the bath water   said
managing director Graham Kenny  Audit and advisory firm PwC concluded
in a report last year there was a general trend among companies of
reforming performance reviews but that removing ratings was still
perceived as a  more radical  change    Clarifies job title  paragraph

Liquide has 32 percent of the market  Linde has 30 percent  Air
Products has 13 percent and Praxair has 7 percent  according to
gasworld  Such market shares would give regulators on both sides of
the Atlantic pause  antitrust experts said  Praxair and Linde will
likely have to review their business with regulators market by market
in regions as small as one metropolitan area  experts said   There
will be a settlement offer  and the question will be whether the U S

Liquide s acquisition of Airgas offers some insight into the scrutiny
to be expected  When the U S  Federal Trade Commission reviewed the
deal  it required a divestiture of assets to preserve competition for
dry ice in the San Francisco Bay area  Adding to the uncertainty are
questions over the FTC s composition next year  The final decision on
antitrust clearance will likely be made by the next administration

quarter earnings of 51 cents a share that topped analysts  estimates

its 2016 operating outlook and forecast that strong growth would
continue in the second half   But investors focused on a 16 percent
decline in new orders from continuing businesses amid weakness in oil

questions about its forecast    You re counting on the second half
being pretty strong  especially in the power business   said Jeff
Windau  an analyst at Edward Jones in St  Louis  referring to power
plant sales    Those are capital intensive purchases and if those get
pushed out even just a little bit  it could weaken GE s performance
GE expects sales for the year to grow at the low end of its 2 percent
to 4 percent target range  But it said reduced orders  which represent
bookings for future sales  would not affect revenue  which comes as
deliveries of actual products and is on course   We have an enormous
backlog  of orders    Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said in
an interview   We don t view it as a concern for future revenue
About 70 percent of the sales that GE expects this year already are in
the backlog  he said  Investors also reacted to GE being about  1
billion short of estimates on free cash flow for the quarter  said
Deane Dray  an analyst at RBC Capital Markets   That was attributed to
slower accounts receivable collection   he said   You don t typically
hear GE talk about that   With the stock having had a strong run  he
added   a little bit of profit taking is understandable   GE shares

222,U S  CEOs back board diversity  GAAP adherence in reform push,"By Ross Kerber BOSTON  Reuters    Leaders of top U S  companies and
investment firms on Thursday released a set of governance
recommendations meant to encourage long term economic growth  an
unusual step that drew mixed reviews from advocates of deeper
corporate reforms  The executive group urged companies to maintain
diverse boards  to feel free to avoid issuing earnings guidance  and
to report results clearly  in keeping with generally accepted
accounting principles  among other suggestions  according to a
statement posted on the group s website  Backers of the principles
included well known chief executives Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase
Co  N JPM   Jeff Immelt of  General Electric  Co  N GE   Larry Fink of
BlackRock Inc  N BLK   Warren Buffett of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc   N
BRKa  and Jeff Ubben of ValueAct Capital  The statement said that
while the group holds varied views on corporate governance   we share
the view that constructive dialogue requires finding common ground   a
starting point to foster the economic growth that benefits
shareholders  employees and the economy as a whole   Questions of how
well companies run themselves have taken on heightened importance
since the financial crisis and with the rise of shareholder activism
bringing challenges to some of the CEOs themselves  Dimon for instance
has beaten back calls to split his dual role as CEO and chairman of
JPMorgan s board  In its statement the CEO group said it began its
work  to see if we could reach some consensus on what we think works
in the real world   The comments drew some praise from the Council of
Institutional Investors  whose voting members include big public
sector pension funds and endowments  Its executive director  Ken
Bertsch  said in an emailed statement that the endorsement of the
guidelines by the stellar executive panel  makes clear that corporate
governance has entered the mainstream   The executives deserve credit
he said  for advocating standards including the election of corporate
directors by majority vote  and calling dual class voting   a
structure in which one share class has less voting power than another
not a best practice    Bertsch said the principles should have gone
further on some issues  however  For instance  they do not address
whether boards should act on proposals endorsed by a majority of
investors  The principles also failed to please everyone on the topics
of director tenure and retirement age  Boards filled with aging
members have become a touchy subject amid calls for more minorities
and women to be represented  Berkshire Hathaway s latest proxy filing
for instance  showed that five of its 12 directors were older than 80
The principles state that companies should spell out their approach on
the matters  Michael Peregrine  a corporate attorney and partner at
the law firm of McDermott  Will   Emery  in an interview called the
approach  a missed opportunity  since the panel could have offered
more specifics to help directors make sensitive decisions on
retirements   Many boards are clamoring for clarity  they want to do
the right thing   he said",2016-07-21,Reuters

225,GE s finance unit sheds its  too big to fail  designation,"By Lisa Lambert and Lewis Krauskopf  Reuters     General Electric  Co
s  N GE  slimmed down financing arm shed its  too big to fail
designation on Wednesday  no longer deemed by the U S  government
systemically important  and so liable to wreck the economy in the
event it runs into distress  The move by the Financial Stability
Oversight Council was the first time a non banking firm has been freed
from the designation  a product of the financial crash that can
trigger stricter oversight and requirements to hold more capital  It
was a big victory for GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt  who since April 2015 has
reached agreements to unload about  180 billion worth of GE Capital
businesses to lessen the industrial conglomerate s exposure to the
finance sector and shed the designation  The oversight council  made
up of all the heads of the major U S  regulatory agencies  voted
unanimously to remove the label it put on GE Capital in 2013
according to the U S  Treasury  One member was recused    The council
will remove a designation when that company no longer poses risks to U
S  financial stability   Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in a
statement   When it identifies a company that could threaten financial
stability  it acts  when those risks change  the council also acts
GE shares were up 1 8 percent in mid day trading after the
announcement  outperforming a 1 4 percent gain for the broader S P 500

services  acquiring  Alstom   PA ALSO   and investing to be a leader
in the industrial Internet   said Immelt in a statement  adding that
in the future GE Capital will support the growth of the corporation s
industrial business  Lifting the designation is expected to allow GE
Capital to free up cash from its balance sheet and allow parent
company GE to deploy it for other uses  particularly share buybacks
and its increased focus on aviation and energy  GE Capital CEO Keith
Sherin said on CNBC the company will now save  several hundred
millions  in regulatory oversight costs over a year   In March GE
Capital formally asked the government to remove the  too big to fail
label  saying the unit had shrunk to the point where it would not pose
a major threat to the country s financial stability if it experienced
distress  DODD FRANK RULES Since the Dodd Frank Wall Street reform law
was passed in 2010  regulators have designated only four non banks as
systemically important  GE Capital was the first to apply to have the
designation removed  and has worked for more than a year with the
council on how best to address its concerns  The designation process
has come under more scrutiny lately  with a federal judge ruling in
March the label does not apply to life insurer MetLife  N MET   The U
S  government has appealed the decision  and last week the authors of
Dodd Frank filed briefs supporting it   American International Group

during the financial crisis  is also deemed systemically important
along with Prudential Financial Inc   N PRU    The council s 23 page
analysis laying out reasons for rescinding GE Capital s designation
will likely not map out how other firms can apply for their own
removal  as the FSOC has said its determinations are made on company
specific evaluations taking into account unique risks posed by each
company   The FSOC designated GE Capital because of its  reliance on
short term wholesale funding and its leading position in a number of
funding markets   Lew said    Since then  GE Capital has made
fundamental strategic changes that have resulted in a company that is
significantly smaller and safer  with more stable funding   he added
GE Capital has said it expects to return about  35 billion in
dividends to the parent company  subject to regulatory approval
including about  18 billion this year  Most investors had expected the
designation to be lifted  but later this year   The fact it came
earlier than expected could give GE Capital  some upside flexibility
on its  18 billion dividend guidance for this year  and  provides a
bit more flexibility on industrial balance sheet leverage   said

226,Interim fix for A400M engine issue certified  Airbus,"By Andrea Shalal RAF FAIRFORD  England  Reuters    European
authorities have certified an interim fix for a power gearbox issue
with engines on Airbus Group SE s  PA AIR  A400M transport aircraft
paving the way for countries to resume normal operations of the planes
company officials said on Saturday   It s good news  It means that we
re going to be alleviating the pain of the nations sooner   Fernando
Alonso  president of Airbus Military Aircraft  told Reuters   It means
they will essentially be able to use the aircraft normally again
Alonso said the European Aviation Safety Agency would now require
initial inspections of the planes after 650 flight hours  up from 100
hours  with follow up inspections to be required every 150 hours  up
from the 20 hour cycle imposed after the gearbox issue first emerged
in late December  The EASA certification clears the way for Italy s
Avio  a unit of  General Electric  Co  N GE   to begin retrofitting
engines on existing planes with a modified part to replace the one
with cracking  It can also begin producing new power gearbox kits with
the part integrated  Airbus said the certification of the interim fix
came a month or more sooner than planned  The company is continuing to
work with GE and Avio on a long term solution for the gearbox  Alonso
said Airbus was also focused on adding tactical capabilities to the
big transport plane  and has delivered the first aircraft capable of
tactical tasks to France   The new plane offers armoring protection
refueling  the ability to airdrop loads  landings on some non prepared
runways and equipment to detect and counter enemy radars and missiles
Airbus has delivered 27 A400M aircraft to date  including a fourth
plane delivered to Germany on Friday  the company said  Nearly all the
aircraft have been affected by the engine issue  although only it
affects only the two clockwise turning engines on each of the four
engine aircraft  It was not immediately clear how quickly Avio could
build and deliver the retrofit kits for planes already delivered  Work
on the kits  and production of power gearboxes with the modified part
would start immediately  Airbus officials said  Airbus officials also
disputed an article in Germany s Spiegel magazine  which cited a link
between cold temperatures in the back of the aircraft and irregular
air flows that could affect paratrooper operations   There is no link
said an Airbus spokeswoman   Airbus said it was working on both issues
and would install a more efficient thermal curtain near the back of
the plane by the end of the year to keep the back of the cabin warmer
The company is also examining a possible readjustment to the air flow
system that would send more warm air to the back of the plane  No
timing was given on that issue  It cited progress on qualifying and
certifying the aircraft for paratrooping operations with one side door
only  or using the ramp     Safety is paramount in this development
program and we would note that the current regulations are very much
stricter than those applied to legacy aircraft   the company said",2016-07-09,Reuters
227,Airbus under new pressure over A400M as deliveries slip,"By Tim Hepher and Cyril Altmeyer PARIS  Reuters    Airbus Group  PA
AIR  faces renewed pressure from France and other European buyers to
meet performance and delivery pledges for its A400M military transport
plane but is struggling to meet the deadlines  people familiar with
the matter said  After partly successful efforts to overcome delays on
Europe s largest defense project  the A400M has been plunged into
uncertainty again  especially due to issues at an Italian
subcontractor that have sparked potential compensation claims  France
has written to Airbus pressing it to say whether problems with Italian
built gearboxes and other threats to the A400M s military
effectiveness will be resolved this year  but Airbus has declined to
give that assurance  the people said  With urgent needs in sub Saharan
Africa and Iraq  France has raised concerns about three main problems
hampering the troop and heavy equipment carrier  gearbox flaws that
require the planes to be checked every 20 flight hours  incomplete
defensive systems and limits on certain types of parachute operation
Asked if Airbus had been able to give clarity on resolving them  one
person familiar with the matter said   No  not right now  and
especially not in the required timetable  which is by the end of this
year   The French government declined to comment  Airbus said it did
not comment on discussions with buyers  The A400M has been ordered by
seven members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization   Belgium
Britain  France  Germany  Luxembourg  Spain and Turkey   to give
Europe an independent airlift capability  German Defence Minister
Ursula von der Leyen said last week that the country would exercise
its right to compensation for delays in deliveries of the A400M and
may have to buy other transport planes as well   In 2010  the A400M
received a 3 5 billion euro bailout and Airbus later overhauled its
management  but problems continue to beset the project launched in
2003 and Airbus is expected to add to the more than 5 billion euros it
has already written off  Last year  a fatal crash that is still being
investigated exposed a vulnerability in cockpit alarm systems  Then
early this year a crack was found inside a power gearbox  PGB  made by
General Electric s  N GE  Italian unit Avio Aero  leading to tough new
inspections   It is currently the main problem and it generates
uncertainty about the number of aircraft that can be delivered this
year  because it is still unknown how many PGBs Avio can provide   a
person close to the project said  Avio s Turin factory  must be
modernized   the person said  adding that things had improved since GE
bought it in 2013  POLITICAL TWISTS An Avio spokesman said   we are
committed to improving our production  and declined comment on the
A400M  Airbus  however  believes it is making progress and hopes to
have a certified long term solution in place for the gearboxes in
September  industry sources said  In April  it said it still hoped to
meet a delivery target of 20 A400Ms in 2016  but that goal is
increasingly in doubt  It has delivered five so far this year
including one to France   We know it is very frustrating for our
customers and are working extremely hard with our engine suppliers and
specifically Avio to work out a solution and implement it as quickly
as we can   an Airbus spokeswoman said  Avio s involvement reflects
the political twists and turns of a program first mooted in the 1980s
Avio was originally part of a French led consortium that bid against
Rolls Royce  L RR  to provide engines for the A400M  The European
engine partners eventually came together to make one combined bid
which won backing in 2000 from politicians over a transatlantic Pratt
Whitney  N UTX  model favored by Airbus  A year later  Italy pulled
out of the A400M project but Avio remained as gearbox supplier to the
European engine team   Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders has faulted
European governments for tying the A400M to an untested engine
consortium  but government officials say past mismanagement is also to
blame  Air chiefs have nonetheless praised the capability of the plane
which Enders last week said would be  worth waiting for   Airbus is
meanwhile weeding out other problems  including replacing an alloy
used below the wing due to a hairline crack  and testing aerodynamic
improvements and equipment changes to allow side door parachute drops
from both sides of the plane   But mid air refueling of helicopters
required by France for its special forces  remains some way off

228,CEO pay in 2015 tamed by bond yields  Fed expectations,"By Sai Sachin R  Reuters    Chief executives of the biggest U S
corporations saw their pay rise in 2015 at the slowest rate in seven
years  but it s not because their boards were suddenly getting tough
The main cause was something far more arcane  bond yields and interest
rates  The nominal amounts set aside by companies to cover pensions
fell substantially last year  a result of rising bond yields and
anticipation of the U S  Federal Reserve s first interest rate hike in
nearly a decade  The smaller pension component   a theoretical amount
to be paid in the future   has eaten into the value of total
compensation packages and muddied the closely scrutinized relationship
between company performance and executive pay   It s the smallest pay
rise in a long time but that doesn t mean that CEOs weren t bringing
home more money   said John Roe  head of advisory at ISS Corporate
Solutions  ICS    The total number doesn t necessarily tell the whole
story   At 0 1 percent  the median pay rise in 2015 for the CEOs of
more than 300 of the S P 500 companies was the smallest since the
financial crisis and a sharp decline from the 12 9 percent hike of
2014  data from ICS shows  The median total pay package was  11 3
million  according to ICS  Taken at face value  the negligible median
pay rise would appear to appease shareholders fretting over high CEO
pay at a time when the S P 500 index  SPX  was about flat in 2015  But
these figures include an incremental value that is added each year to
an executive s pension pot  to be paid out on retirement  Strip away
these pension values and the median S P 500 pay rise was 3 7 percent
in 2015  more in line with the 4 6 percent rise a year earlier
excluding pensions  The incremental pension value set aside by CBS
Corp  N CBS  for Leslie Moonves  the top paid CEO of an S P 500
company  was just  421 021 last year   roughly a seventh of the  2 8
million designated a year earlier  But Moonves still took home  52 2
million last year  up from  49 5 million in 2014  The value of
General Electric  Co  N GE  CEO Jeff Immelt s pension and other
deferred earnings fell to about  6 million in 2015 from about  18
million a year earlier  Though Immelt s total compensation fell 11 5
percent to  33 million  his take home pay actually rose  to about  10
million from  9 6 million a year earlier  The incremental pension
value set aside by weapons maker  Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT  for
CEO Marillyn Hewson nearly halved to  8 4 million  dragging her total
2015 pay package down 15 percent to  28 6 million  ICS estimates that
the value of these incremental pension amounts fell nearly 57 percent
in 2015  pulling down total compensation by 6 7 percent  The ICS data
covers 337 companies  or about two thirds of the S P 500  and excludes
those which have changed their CEO in the last two years or whose
financial year does not align with the calendar year  To be sure  the
changing pension values affect only those executives who have chosen a
lump sum pension payment  rather than installments to be paid through
their lifetime  and the total pay disclosed in proxy filings may
differ from the compensation actually realized by executives  due to
stock awards and other miscellaneous items  FED RATE HIKE So why did
pension values fall so much in 2015  Interest rates are used to value
these lump sum pension payments in today s dollars  If a company were
to deposit money in a bank or invest in bonds  its value would grow
over time  The higher the interest rate  the more that money would
grow  meaning a smaller initial amount must be set aside today
Conversely  when interest rates are low  companies must set aside more
money to meet their future pension obligations  Pension values were
already high in 2014  due partly to higher life expectancy but also
because bond yields were falling and near zero interest rates were
expected to persist  Then  in 2015  expectations mounted that the
Federal Reserve would hike rates  in December  it did  Corporate bond
yields rose about 40 basis points over the year  All of this helped to
drag down the total current value of pension promises by roughly 5
percent  said Dave Suchsland  Philadelphia based senior consulting
actuary at Willis Towers Watson  an insurance brokerage and advisory
This year  pension values and their relation to CEO pay are
unpredictable  While the Fed is indicating that a hike in interest
rates could happen in the coming months  bond yields   affected not
just by rate hikes  but a variety of macroeconomic factors   are
moving in the other direction  A near certainty  however  is that
stock based compensation  which offset the fall in pension values in
2015  will continue to rise   Performance based compensation  of which
stock based pay is a major component  has been rising steadily in
recent years  reaching a record level of about 55 percent of total pay
in 2015  said Roe",2016-06-14,Reuters
229,Rosatom s global nuclear ambition cramped by Kremlin politics,"By Geert De Clercq  Svetlana Burmistrova and Jack Stubbs PARIS MOSCOW
Reuters    The  100 billion overseas order book of Russia s nuclear
power plant builder Rosatom    bigger than all its Western competitors
combined    makes it look like the giant in its field  But if the
company    formed in 2007 from the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry and
tasked with turning nuclear power into a major export industry    is
ever to reach its potential as a global industrial giant  it will have
to shed Russia s reputation for using energy policy as a means to
political ends  Deal after deal has collapsed in Europe  where
individual countries and the European Union as a whole consider it a
priority to reduce dependency on Russian energy  and relations have
deteriorated over Moscow s intervention in Ukraine  A project in fast
growing  energy hungry Turkey    possibly the ideal market on paper
has been stalled because of a collapse in relations between the two
countries supporting opposite sides in the Syrian civil war  And an
array of deals announced in poorer developing countries like Egypt
Jordan and Bangladesh seem unlikely to reach fruition any time soon
because of the countries  lack of experience with nuclear power
shortage of capital and grids that are unsuitable   Rosatom is pretty
good at announcing  100 billion euros of orders in 25 countries  but
not an awful lot of these are firm contracts  they are just bits of
paper   said Steve Kidd at East Cliff Consulting   Since the 2011
Fukushima disaster  the world nuclear industry has been stagnant as
Germany and other countries decided to exit nuclear  Japan closed most
of its reactors and even China reduced its pace of nuclear expansion
Supporters say nuclear power still has a future as a proven technology
to generate electricity without emitting carbon that causes global
warming  But low gas and coal prices and the competition of
increasingly cheap wind and solar power have made it uneconomical in
large parts of the world  In the United States  several nuclear plants
have closed and in Europe new nuclear plants can only be built with
state subsidy  as French utility EDF s Hinkley Point project in
Britain shows   Yet Rosatom still announces a new deal every few
months as it markets nuclear to developing countries  It offers a
unique business model in which it finances  builds and operates the
nuclear plants  and then takes away the waste   Experts say many of
these deals have little chance of turning into firm contracts  as many
of these countries are decades away from being able to use nuclear
energy in their grids   In more developed countries like Hungary and
Turkey  where Rosatom won billions worth of nuclear reactor orders
its projects have been stalled for years due lack of funding  local
opposition and suspicions about the Kremlin s political motives   The
Russians are increasingly viewing their energy fuels and technologies
as a lever for foreign policy   Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace associate Mark Hibbs said   Rosatom declined to comment on the
status of its foreign projects or whether its investments had a
political component  The Kremlin did not immediately reply to written
questions submitted by Reuters  But Rosatom First Deputy Director
General Kirill Komarov said in November the firm s contracts abroad
were solid    All of the contracts that we have already signed we
think to be very reliable   he said at a nuclear conference  FLURRY OF
MOU S Turkey was an ideal market for Rosatom  A large developing
market  with its own scientific community  domestic capital and fast
growing power needs  as well as a cross roads for energy
infrastructure  But it also shows how politics trumps commerce  In
2013  Rosatom won a  20 billion contract to build four reactors in
Akkuyu in what was to become Turkey s first nuclear plant as Ankara
tried to cut reliance on imported energy  But late last year  Rosatom
stopped construction following the downing of a Russian jet flying
sorties over Syria near the Turkey Syria border  The incident led to a
crisis in relations between Turkey  which supports rebels fighting
against Syrian President Bashar al Assad  and Russia which has
intervened in support of his government  In April  a source told
Reuters a Turkish construction firm is in talks about buying up to 49
percent of the project  Komarov told Reuters in May the Akkuyu project
had not collapsed   The project is not subject to sanctions  As far as
we know  work is continuing   he said  EXPERIENCE Russia has a lot of
experience building reactors abroad  there are Soviet era reactors all
over Eastern Europe  But without a captive market and facing fierce
competition from other vendors  Rosatom has built relatively few
reactors since 2007  two in Tianwan  China  one in Bushehr  Iran  and
one in Kudankulam  India are working  Rosatom said a second one in
Kudankulam will start operating this month   Experts say some deals
Rosatom boasts about are not contracts  just a  memorandum of
understanding  or  framework agreement   Many of these are with
countries that will not be ready for nuclear for years  if not decades
such as Algeria  Argentina  Bolivia and Nigeria   Russia is not the
only nuclear vendor to sign MOUs with unlikely customers  China
recently signed a nuclear agreement with Sudan  and before its
government bailout France s  Areva  also spoke of selling numerous
reactors in developing countries   In more advanced emerging markets
like South Africa and Vietnam  Rosatom competes with U S   French
Chinese  Japanese and Korean vendors  all eager to win business in the
tight market since Fukushima    I would not draw the conclusion that
Russia is about ready to take over the nuclear universe   CEIP s Hibbs
said   For competitors like GE Hitachi   N GE   T 6501  Toshiba  T
6502  and Areva   PA AREVA  Rosatom s frenetic dealmaking    even if
it leads to few firm contracts    is a worry  as it allows Russia to
occupy the terrain   The Russians are clever  they announce lots of
deals and freeze the market  so other vendors stay away   said a board
member of a nuclear reactor builder  DEALS COME UNDONE Russia s most
focused nuclear export drive is in Europe  which is trying to wean
itself off Russian gas as its main source of energy for power
generation  Opponents suspect the Kremlin of aiming to use nuclear
power to wield political leverage  the way it has with gas  turning
the taps down during confrontations with Ukraine   As Russia s gas
card is losing its strength  it tries to play the electricity card
said Greenpeace Eastern Europe energy specialist Jan Haverkamp
Several Rosatom attempts to break into the EU market via former East
bloc countries have come to nothing  although these projects had
seemed like serious prospects a few years ago  In Bulgaria  a contract
to build two reactors at Belene on the Danube River was abandoned in
2012 for lack of financing   From Kaliningrad  a Russian territory
located between Poland and Lithuania  Rosatom hoped to export power to
Poland and even Germany with an undersea cable  That plan too was
quietly dropped around 2013 as it became clear there was no hope of
selling electricity into the EU   In 2014  Czech utility CEZ scrapped
a tender for the  15 billion Temelin project   where a Russian
consortium and Westinghouse were the two remaining bidders   due to
low power prices and the state s refusal to provide price guarantees
That same year  Hungary awarded Rosatom   without a tender   a
contract for two reactors in Paks  In November 2015  the European
Commission launched proceedings over the contract saying it could
infringe the EU s procurement rules  and opened an investigation into
possible illegal state aid   Rosatom s best chance to build a reactor
in the EU could be in Finland  where it bought a 34 percent stake in
consortium Fennovoima from German utility E ON  DE EONGn  on condition
it could build a reactor in the Hanhikivi peninsula   After a row
about Russian investors trying to use a Croatian firm to circumvent
shareholder nationality requirements  Russia finally convinced Finnish
utility  Fortum   HE FUM1V  to buy into Fennovoima   Experts expect
Rosatom will divert resources from Paks and other projects to speed up
the Finnish project  and stay ahead of China  which also wants to
break into the EU  Chinese utility CGN in 2015 signed a deal with
Britain to build a reactor there in exchange for financing French
utility EDF s nuclear project in Hinkley Point  Meanwhile  whether any
new plants ever get built  Rosatom is likely to keep signing new deals
around the globe    Rosatom likes to sign MOUs everywhere  they like
one every few months  for the photo opportunity   Haverkamp said",2016-06-26,Reuters
230,Exclusive  Westinghouse to get new site for Indian nuclear plant   officials,"By Douglas Busvine and Rupam Jain NEW DELHI  Reuters    Toshiba Corp s
T 6502  Westinghouse Electric will relocate a planned project to build
six nuclear reactors in India  said officials  bringing the first deal
stemming from a U S  India civil nuclear accord struck over a decade
ago closer to reality  The six AP 1000 reactors would be built in the
southern state of Andhra Pradesh  after the original site proposed for
the multi billion dollar project  in Prime Minister Narendra Modi s
home state of Gujarat  faced local opposition  The breakthrough comes
ahead of a June 7 8 visit by Modi to Washington  where he will be
hosted by President Barack Obama for a final summit before the U S
presidential election in November  and will address both houses of
Congress  U S  lawmakers ratified the civil nuclear accord three years
after it was struck in 2005  as part of an attempt to deepen the
strategic relationship with India  but have expressed growing dismay
over its failure to yield follow on deals for U S  based reactor
makers like Westinghouse  One obstacle was bringing India s liability
rules into line with international norms  which require the costs of
an accident to be channeled to the operator rather than the maker of a
nuclear power station  But  following the announcement of a
breakthrough understanding  on nuclear cooperation during Obama s
visit to India in January 2015  this issue has been resolved to the
satisfaction of the U S  government and it is down to commercial
partners to agree a deal  Analysts say resolving the land issue is a
crucial step  but complex issues remain  including project financing
and reaching a civil nuclear pact with Japan  where Westinghouse
parent Toshiba is based   Some time before the end of the calendar
year they may be able to close   said Ashley Tellis  a senior
associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace  who was a
negotiator for the George W  Bush administration in the U S  India
nuclear talks  India wants to dramatically increase its nuclear
capacity to 63 000 MW by 2032 to meet growing demand and restrict its
reliance on fossil fuels  and has struck a series of accords with
other countries to help meet that goal  Russia s Rosatom operates two
reactors at Kudankulam  in Tamil Nadu  while France s EDF  PA EDF
signed a preliminary deal with the state owned Nuclear Power
Corporation of India  NPCIL   NPCIL UL  in January to build six
reactors at Jaitapur  Maharashtra  EAST COAST Indian federal and state
officials confirmed that NPCIL  which would operate the plants  had
made a down payment on 2 000 acres  800 hectares  of land in the
eastern coastal district of Srikakulam   The land acquisition was
stuck for over a decade  but now it s coming to a conclusion   Ajay
Jain  energy secretary of Andhra Pradesh  told Reuters  adding the
purchase would close this year   Construction can begin in 2017
Ninety percent of local farmers had agreed to sell their land  they
were being well compensated and no court cases were pending  Jain
added  Two sources  requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the
matter  confirmed that the site was being acquired for Westinghouse
which plans to build six AP 1000 pressurized water reactors  each with
a design capacity of around 1 100 megawatts  Westinghouse did not
respond to requests for comment  while senior executives at NPCIL were
not available  Westinghouse CEO Danny Roderick told Reuters earlier
this year that an Indian reactor deal was close  but negotiators
missed a deadline to wrap it up before Obama hosted a nuclear security
summit in Washington in April  FRUIT FARMERS Westinghouse was
originally offered a site at Mithi Virdi in Gujarat  on India s west

has had more success in acquiring land for development than some rival
states  acquiring tracts of land for a new state capital by offering
farmers future plots developed for commercial or residential buildings

uncertain future might feel as dizzying as the 220 metre drop

impact of the galloping franc  Six decades after opening  Schindler s
hometown factory in Ebikon that decades ago employed hundreds will be
scaled back to under 100 employees by the end of 2017  They will focus

since the  franc shock   the central bank s abandonment in January
2015 of the ceiling for the franc against the euro that abruptly made
Swiss goods a fifth costlier abroad  The franc s leap unleashed a wave
of job cuts as factories shut down and small manufacturers struggled
to keep afloat  Now fears are mounting that jobs in the manufacturing
sector    still a bedrock of the Swiss economy even as other advanced
economies shift more to services    are going for good after being
whittled away during decades of automation and offshoring   These jobs
aren t coming back   said Guido Schluep  secretary general of industry
at the Syna union  who has helped negotiate the extent of job cuts at
Schindler  Switzerland has long had an international reputation for
high quality manufacturing of everything from luxury watches and
precision instruments to Nespresso capsules  S NESN  and cancer drugs
as well as Schindler elevators and escalators  BUCKING TREND Bucking
the trend in nearly every other developed country  manufacturing has
gained importance for the Swiss economy over the past 25 years  It
accounted for 19 5 percent of Swiss economic output last year  up from
17 6 percent in 1991  Just over 620 000 jobs    or 16 percent of the
total    are in manufacturing  twice the percentage in countries such
as Britain  once known for robust industry  But the number is down
from 800 000 in 1991  when industry generated 23 2 percent of Swiss
payrolls  Since last year s shock  manufacturing employment has fallen
1 6 percent while overall numbers of workers stagnated on a seasonally
adjusted basis  based on first quarter figures  Outsourcing
automation and a shift towards high end products requiring less manual
input had already taken their toll on the numbers employed  A boom in
the pharmaceutical and chemical industries has seen the Swiss economy
through difficult years  offsetting industry s emaciation and buoying
trade  But these businesses contribute only modestly to Swiss jobs
representing just one in eight manufacturing posts and generally
requiring technical training or beyond  While jobs in the
pharmaceutical industry may have nearly doubled in the past 25 years
one in three mechanical production jobs has become obsolete  Even as
order books start filling and revenues rebound  experts say layoffs
could take another year and a half to work their way through the
industry  The mechanical and electrical engineering industry has taken
a particularly hard hit  with payrolls falling more than 4 percent in
just over a year  Industry lobby Swissmem calls this an  accelerated
structural change  in which manufacturers move manual work to cheaper

Johann Schneider Ammann    an industry mogul himself    to the leader
of the Social Democrats warn that creeping deindustrialisation could
take a turn for the worse if the franc strengthens again  The franc
hit a five week high against the euro on Tuesday  The government has
been consulting with business but has said it sees no need for a
special economic stimulus package  Unlike previous crises in which
state subsidised short work hours helped companies limit wage costs
while ensuring they could ramp up production once good times returned
employers are hardly positioning themselves to bring those jobs back

signs of a pick up  But while production and exports showed some signs
of stabilisation in the first quarter  Credit Suisse said it was too

232,Employer health benefits for U S  retirees keep declining,"By Mark Miller CHICAGO  Reuters     The opinions expressed here are
those of the author  a columnist for Reuters   Planning for retirement
is tough enough   and it gets even tougher when retirement benefits
you expect to receive from an employer are changed on short notice
But a growing number of U S  employers are capping their risk of
rising health insurance costs by sending retirees into private
exchanges to buy coverage   often with little advance warning   Two
thirds of employers provided retiree health coverage as recently as
1988  according to the Kaiser Family Foundation  This was usually
supplemental coverage to pay for prescription drugs  cap out of pocket
expenses or to cover Medicare s deductibles and co pays   By last year
that number had dwindled to just 23 percent  Among the employers that
still cover retirees  a growing number are shifting retirees into
insurance exchanges  Similar to a shift from a defined benefit to a
defined contribution  the expense risk is shifted from employer to
retiree  Soon to be released data from Aon Hewitt  a consulting firm
that operates exchanges for employers  shows that 35 percent of public
and private sector employers are using healthcare exchanges for all or
some of their Medicare eligible retirees  Of those that are not  17
percent say they will do so in the future  and another 46 percent say
they are considering it  Healthcare is a major  unpredictable expense
in retirement  so unexpected switches can affect a retirement plan
Typically  plan sponsors provide their Medicare eligible workers
between six months to one year of advance notice of these changes
according to John Grosso  a senior vice president at Aon Hewitt who
leads the firm s retiree consulting practice  GE MOVE PROMPTS LAWSUITS
The latest poster child for this type of change is  General Electric
NYSE GE  Co  which disclosed in its annual report for 2015 that it is
saving  3 3 billion by sending many of its retirees into insurance
exchanges with a subsidy to purchase coverage  The changes were
effective on Jan  1  2016  GE s move has prompted two lawsuits  One
was by salaried workers claiming that the company broke promises it
made to continue coverage and that it violated the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act  The second suit was filed by a coalition of
unions representing GE workers  and it claims that the change violates
collective bargaining agreements  In the first case  a judge already
has denied a GE motion for dismissal  but the company is also seeking
dismissal of the case brought by the unions  General Electric did not
respond to requests for comment  HEALTH REFORM DRIVES CHANGE Grosso
said the Affordable Care Act has been a major driver of the shift to
exchanges  The law improved the Medicare Part D prescription drug
benefit by phasing out the gap in coverage known as the  doughnut hole
and by introducing reforms in the Medicare Advantage plans   Also
driving the shift  he said  is the flood of baby boomers entering
retirement  These younger retirees drive down the premiums in
marketplace plans  since they tend to utilize less healthcare than
older retirees  That makes the plans even more attractive as options
for plan sponsors  That allows for a  win win  situation in many cases
at least initially   The overwhelming number of plan sponsors we work
with pick a subsidy amount that balances their need to save money with
savings that the retiree can achieve in the exchange  It s a win win
in the short term  financially   But Grosso acknowledged there is
potential longer term risk to retirees  depending on how the subsidy
is designed   The question is whether the sponsor grows the benefit or
keeps it flat  as healthcare costs and premiums rise over time
Indeed  Aon data shows that  Fifty nine percent of companies sending
retirees into exchanges do not index the subsidy  28 percent index at
their own discretion and 13 percent automatically adjust the subsidy
amount annually  Companies that do index the benefit grow it anywhere
from 3 to 5 percent annually  Grosso said   The complex task of
shopping for insurance in an exchange is another hurdle  Grosso said
95 percent of retirees using exchanges take advantage of benefit
advisors who help guide their plan selections   It s really a key
issue for them to understand the market   he said   But they are not
doing this on their own",2016-04-14,Reuters

hopeful Bernie Sanders doubled down on Thursday on his assertion that
his rival for the Democratic Party s nomination  Hillary Clinton  is
unqualified to be president as the two campaigns became increasingly
testy two weeks before New York s election contest  Clinton  stung by
a string of losses in other states  this week sharply questioned
Sanders  credentials and ability to carry out a campaign pledge to
break up the big banks  Sanders  a U S  senator from Vermont  told
reporters in Philadelphia that Clinton had come after him in a  really
uncalled for way  and again questioned the Democratic front runner s
own fitness for the Oval Office   Are you qualified to be president of
the United States when you re raising millions of dollars from Wall
Street  an entity whose greed  recklessness and illegal behavior
helped destroy our economy   Sanders said at a news conference  In
what has become an increasing source of acrimony in the Democratic
campaign  the former Senator and U S  Secretary of State Clinton has
angrily bristled at Sanders  repeated suggestion that the large
amounts of donations she receives from the financial industry clouds
her independence  a notion she ridicules   Brian Fallon  a Clinton
spokesman  said Sanders   unqualified  comment was a  new low  in the
race  The focus of Democratic and Republican Party campaigns to choose
candidates to run in the Nov  8 election for the White House has
shifted to the April 19 primary in New York  home to Wall Street and
two of the leading candidates  Clinton and Republican real estate
businessman Donald Trump  Trump canceled plans to campaign in
California on Friday in order to focus on New York where he is hiring
additional staff  his campaign said   Trump has reminded Republican
voters that Ted Cruz  a U S  senator from Texas and Trump s nearest
rival  has spoken derisively of  New York values   his suggestion

WALL STREET For the Democrats  the New York based financial industry
was in the spotlight  Clinton has won significantly more votes so far
but Sanders is proving increasingly popular  with national surveys
showing them both more or less tied among voters  Sanders found
himself defending his remarks on Wall Street in an awkward interview
with the New York Daily News  the transcript prompting a wave of
critical articles by political journalists this week   Clinton  who
represented New York as a U S  senator for eight years  said Sanders
seemed unaware in his answers of the details and implications of one
of his signature policies of Wall Street reform  breaking up big banks
Economists who support Sanders defended his answers as accurate
saying the interviewer appeared at times to confuse the Federal
Reserve with the U S  Treasury Department  Sanders  interview drew
criticism from other quarters  In an opinion essay in the Washington
Post on Thursday   General Electric   NYSE GE  Co  s chief executive
Jeff Immelt  defended his company against Sanders  suggestion it was
an exemplar of corporate greed  While sitting down with the Daily News
Sanders  a Brooklyn native  also revealed his mistaken belief that New
York City commuters still had to use small metal tokens to ride the
subway  a system scrapped in 2003   Teasing this  Clinton invited a
crowd of journalists to watch her use a digital swipe card at a subway
station on Thursday morning   I think it was my first term when we
changed from tokens to MetroCards   she told reporters  a dig at
Sanders  When at the turnstile  however  Clinton experienced what many
New Yorkers do every day   it took several swipes for the card to
register and allow her to proceed to the train   If Secretary Clinton
thinks that I just come from a small state of Vermont and we re not
used to this  well  we will get used to it fast   Sanders said   I m
not going to get beaten up  I m not getting lied about  We will fight
back    Spokesmen for Clinton noted that Clinton never said the word
unqualified  when she questioned his preparedness for the presidency
but they declined to say if that is what she believed him to be  But
Clinton  ahead of her subway ride on Thursday  aimed for a more
magnanimous tone than her aides    I don t know why he s saying that

arbitrary and capricious   the U S  judge who struck down the
determination last month wrote in an opinion that was unsealed on
Thursday  The U S  government plans to appeal the court decision  a
Treasury spokesman said in a statement late on Thursday  Treasury
Secretary Jack Lew said he strongly disagreed with the decision and
the government would vigorously defend the work of the Financial
Stability Oversight Council  FSOC   made up of several U S  regulatory
agency chiefs  which designated MetLife as a systemically important
financial institution in 2014  The label has been given to four
nonbank companies that the government considers would pose a risk to
the financial system if they collapsed  MetLife  the largest U S  life
insurer  has said it was considering breaking up its business to shed
the designation  which triggers more regulation   This decision leaves
one of the largest and most highly interconnected financial companies
in the world subject to even less oversight than before the financial
crisis   Lew said in a statement earlier on Thursday   I am confident
that we will prevail    MetLife sued the U S  government last year
saying FSOC used a secretive  flawed process in determining that it
could hurt the U S  financial system if it faces financial distress
On March 30  U S  District Judge Rosemary Collyer rescinded the
designation  but her opinion was put under seal until Thursday  FSOC
said in its designation that the insurer could cause significant
damage to the U S  economy  but never explained how it would result
Collyer wrote   That assumption reflected a change in policy  one that
was neither acknowledged nor explained in the final determination  and
which was therefore arbitrary and capricious   she wrote  She added
that during the designation process  FSOC ignored two of its own
definitions of  material financial distress  and  threat to the
financial stability of the United States    FSOC also focused
exclusively on the presumed benefits of its designation and ignored
the attendant costs  which is itself unreasonable   Collyer wrote
FSOC s unacknowledged departure from its guidance and express refusal
to consider cost require the court to rescind the final determination
Authority to designate U S  nonbank companies as  too big to fail  is
part of the Dodd Frank Wall Street reform law passed after the 2008
financial crisis  Last week lender GE Capital  a unit of  General
Electric  Co  N GE   asked to have its designation removed  saying it
had shrunk to the point where it would not pose a threat to the

Group Inc  N AIG   which also has the label  received a  182 billion U
S  government bailout to avoid collapse in the thick of the financial
crisis  AIG declined to comment on Collyer s decision  Lew said FSOC
takes  a deliberative and data driven approach  relying on a careful
analysis of available information  including intensive engagement with
each company  it designates    In overturning the conclusions of

Democratic presidential contenders Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton

Sanders was endorsed by New York City transit workers in his fight for
union support that has largely gone to Clinton  Sanders addressed
hundreds of striking workers in Brooklyn as  brothers and sisters  and
thanked them for their courage in standing up to what he characterized
as corporate greed by the mammoth communications company  Employees
cheered as Sanders  who was born in Brooklyn  criticized  Verizon
Communications  Inc  N VZ  for wanting to take away health benefits
outsource jobs and avoid federal income taxes  calling it  just
another major American corporation trying to destroy the lives of
working Americans    Today I became a Bernie supporter  Basically just
having his presence and knowing that he acknowledges the working class
matters   said technician Kerryann Reid  36  who said she has worked
for Verizon for 15 years  It was a scene tailor made for the U S

campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination  Sanders is trying
to catch up with Clinton  the front runner  in Tuesday s primary in
New York  a state both candidates have called home  On Wednesday
afternoon  several dozen workers picketing a Verizon store in
Manhattan cheered as Clinton arrived to show her support    This has
been going on for months   she said of the deadlocked contract talks
adding that the employees needed all the support they could get
Despite Sanders  daily championing of the rights of working class
Americans  Clinton has racked up the lion s share of support from
organized labor  a crucial base for the Democratic Party  Among
Democrats and independents who belong to a labor union  50 percent
support Clinton and 36 percent back Sanders  according to a Reuters
Ipsos national poll in March  In comparison  Clinton and Sanders have
been about even in the poll among all Democrats and independents  The
poll from March 1 to March 31 included 780 people who said they were
Democrats or independents and belonged to a labor union  It had a
credibility interval of 4 percentage points  Nearly 40 000 Verizon
employees went on strike on Wednesday in one of the largest U S
walkouts in recent years after contract talks hit an impasse
STANDING UP FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS   You are standing up not just
for justice for Verizon workers  you re standing up for millions of
Americans     and you re telling corporate America that they cannot
have it all   Sanders told the striking workers  Verizon Chief
Executive Officer Lowell McAdam accused Sanders of getting the facts
wrong and oversimplifying the situation  dismissing the candidate s
views as  contemptible   The company has to adapt to competition and
technology  but still provides good jobs and benefits to thousands  he
said in a statement  Sanders fired back on Twitter at McAdam and
General Electric  Co  N GE  Chief Executive Jeff Immelt  who
criticized Sanders in an opinion article last week   I don t want the
support of McAdam  Immelt and their friends in the billionaire class
Sanders wrote   I welcome their contempt   While Sanders whipped up
the crowd in Brooklyn  Clinton s campaign issued a statement
criticizing Verizon for wanting to outsource more jobs and urging the
company to go back to the bargaining table   To preserve and grow
America s middle class  we need to protect good wages and benefits
including retirement security   Clinton said   And we should be doing
all we can to keep good paying jobs with real job security in New York
Earlier in the day  Sanders announced the endorsement of Transport
Workers Union Local 100  representing 42 000 workers in the New York
City area   Clinton  meanwhile  won the backing of a local unit
representing more than 27 000 area workers  of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers  one of the unions involved in the
Verizon strike  The other union involved in the strike  the

238,GE Capital asks U S  government to lift  too big to fail  designation,"By Lisa Lambert WASHINGTON  Reuters    Lender GE Capital asked the U S
government on Thursday to stop designating it as  too big to fail
saying it had shrunk to the point where it would not pose a major
threat to the nation s financial stability if it experiences distress
Chief Executive Officer Keith Sherin said in a statement that the
General Electric  Co  N GE  unit no longer met the criteria for a
systemically important financial institution   a label that can
trigger requirements for stricter oversight and more capital  The
application came the day after a federal judge struck down the
designation of insurer MetLife Inc  N MET   but GE Capital said the
two events were unrelated  The company had said in October that it
hoped to apply to the Financial Stability Oversight Council  which
includes the Treasury secretary and Federal Reserve chair  for  de
designation  in the first quarter  The 2010 Dodd Frank Wall Street
reform law authorized regulators to designate non bank financial
companies as systemically important  largely in response to the near
collapse of insurer American International Group Inc  N AIG  and the
182 billion U S  government bailout it received during the 2008
economic meltdown   Only four non banks have been deemed too big to
fail  and the label has prompted most to consider reorganizing to pre
empt any increased regulation  GE Capital is the first to apply to
have the designation removed  Shares of General Electric were up 0 4
percent at  31 96 in afternoon trading  The industrial conglomerate
has been working to reduce GE Capital s size and said last April that
it would focus on technology and manufacturing   GE Capital  which
received the systemically important label in 2013  said it had more
than halved its assets to  265 billion from  549 billion at the end of
2012   The unit said it had ended all consumer lending in the United
States  reduced real estate debt by more than 75 percent  eliminated
its real estate equity and cut outstanding commercial paper by almost
90 percent   Our plan to change our business model  shrink the company
and reduce our risk profile has been successful   Sherin said
SIGNIFICANTLY DE RISKED  The Financial Stability Oversight Council
welcomes the opportunity to evaluate developments at any designated
non bank financial company and their potential effect on financial
stability   said Treasury spokesman Rob Friedlander   There is a clear
process for de designation   Each year the council reviews its
previous designations and decides whether any changes at a company
justify a rescission of the label  he said   Before the financial
crisis  some of the largest  riskiest non bank financial companies
were not subject to adequate oversight   Friedlander added   S P
Global Market Intelligence analyst Jim Corridore  who follows General
Electric  said in a note on Thursday that he expected GE Capital s
designation to be removed   GE Capital s transformation has
significantly de risked the company   Corridore said  MetLife  the
largest U S  life insurer  sued after it was designated systemically
important in 2014  Earlier this year  it said the  regulatory
environment  and potentially large capital requirements were causing
it to consider spinning off its retail business   Meanwhile
billionaire investor Carl Icahn has pressured AIG to split into
smaller companies to shed its designation   AIG CEO Pete Hancock said
on Thursday that the MetLife court decision created an opportunity for
the company to seek de designation  but it was  reserving judgment

important in 2013  did not immediately respond to a request for

240,MetLife challenges U S   too big to fail  designation in court,"By Lisa Lambert WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  government and the
country s largest life insurer squared off in federal court on
Wednesday over whether regulators can designate non banking firms as
too big to fail   one of the major reforms that followed the financial
crisis  U S  District Judge Rosemary Collyer heard MetLife Inc  N MET
s arguments that the Financial Stability Oversight Council  FSOC  used
a secretive and flawed process when it designated the insurer as
systemically important  MetLife received the designation in 2014 when
the heads of the major U S  financial regulatory agencies determined
that a collapse of the insurer could devastate the U S  financial
system just as much as failure of a major bank such as  Citigroup   N
C  or Goldman Sachs  N GS   Other non bank firms receiving the
designation were insurers American International Group Inc  N AIG
and Prudential Financial  N PRU   Inc   and  General Electric   N GE
Capital   MetLife sued last year  It said the council  which includes
the Treasury Secretary and Federal Reserve Chair  had not followed its
own guidance on designating a firm as systemically important
essentially changing the rules to ensure the determination was made
In court on Wednesday  the federal government argued that its process
was fair and that a collapse by the insurer  with its many financial
ties  products and contracts  would indeed hurt the financial system
It said it was open with the company during a 17 month process that
included exchange of thousands of pages of documents and several
meetings  including one with the full council  At the heart of the
case is whether the government can designate non banks as systemically
important  an authority it received in the 2010 Dodd Frank Wall Street
reform law after AIG required a government bailout of  182 billion
during the 2008 financial meltdown   Collyer  who is expected to rule
in a few months  questioned the FSOC structure  specifically how it
gathers information and forms judgments on companies  stability  She
drew a comparison to how other agencies perform administrative
adjudication  such as the Securities and Exchange Commission  where
internal administrative courts operate separately from other areas
There s nobody neutral in this  They all have an interest   she said
about the FSOC structure where analytical teams report to committees
who then report to the council  helping formulate a final decision
She also asked about assessing the firm s vulnerability and why the
council did not conduct a risk analysis  FSOC began with the
hypothetical premise that MetLife was on the brink of insolvency
That s not risk analysis  That s taking the risk out of it  That s
assuming the worst of the worst of the worst   she said  FSOC s
attorneys said it is not charged with determining the probability that
a firm will fail  only forecasting possible consequences of a failure
Non bank firms designated systemically important must hold more
capital and comply with rules intended to stave off the need for a
federal bailout should they fail  The rules have yet to be finalized
Last month  MetLife said it plans to split up due to the  regulatory
environment  and pressure is mounting on other firms to also shrink
and shed the designation  MetLife says it should not be designated as
systemically important because there are no  runs  on insurance
policies  But FSOC says many of the firm s financial products go
beyond insurance and could require payment on demand  Insurance is
regulated at the state level  and MetLife says the designation could
force it to comply with two layers of regulation  The National
Association of Insurance Commissioners has filed a court brief
supporting MetLife s lawsuit   FSOC s insurance sector representative
was the only member to vote against the systemically important
designation",2016-02-10,Reuters
241,Solar tower poised to energize market,"By Ari Rabinovitch In a vast expanse of open desert in southern Israel
a 787 foot tower  240 meters  is taking shape that its builders hope
will help make solar energy much more cost effective      The tower
being built by Israel based Megalim Solar Power  whose shareholders
include  General Electric   N GE   will be taller than other solar
towers  enabling it to generate up to 121 megawatts of power      Due
to be completed late next year at a cost of 3 billion shekels   773
million   the facility will provide around 1 percent of Israel s
electricity under an agreement with the Israeli government  which aims
for 10 percent of the country s energy needs to be provided by
renewables by 2020      Most solar power in the world is generated by
photovoltaic  PV  panels  which can be installed anywhere from a roof
to a backyard  In contrast  towers that use concentrated solar power
known as CSP  require a lot of land and are only cost efficient in
large scale projects      For that reason they have seen limited
deployment  and mainly in the United States and Europe      Megalim s
tower in the Negev desert  which stands out for miles around  is
surrounded by 50 000 computer controlled mirrors  to project the sun s
rays  They are bigger than in previous projects and controlled over a
dedicated Wifi network  rather than with expensive cables used in the
past  Megalim says      The tower is privately funded but when
completed the Israeli government has guaranteed to buy the power from
it at an above market price      That means it will be effectively
subsidized  but Megalim says it is working to further reduce costs
Shareholders including power tower pioneer Brightsource Energy as well
as General Electric  which will provide the turbine  want to build
more such towers around the world       We re making strides in
efficiency  we re making strides in compressing the time of
construction   said Megalim s Chief Executive Eran Gartner   We re
going down a learning curve that will help us to offer solar energy at
the most competitive rates       To narrow the gap with PV panels
which make up 95 percent of the solar market  the U S  based Solar
Energy Industries Association says CSP needs to reduce hardware costs
and to twin its output with an energy storage element that will allow
electricity production at night       Megalim s tower in Israel will
generate heat of up to 540 degrees Celsius  1 000 Fahrenheit
producing steam to drive a turbine  It will not be able to store
energy but has overcome another problem that beset solar towers
whether or not power towers were killing large numbers of birds
When Brightsource built a three tower facility in Ivanpah  California
in 2013 with local partners  some experts said heat from its mirrors
would incinerate tens of thousands of birds each year  A public outcry
about the issue was in part responsible for Brightsource cancelling
plans to build another tower complex in California        An official
report  based on findings by biologists and teams of dogs that combed
the Ivanpah facility  documenting and categorizing every bird death
has since shown the impact to be low      Brightsource has come up
with new techniques to minimize the damage  said Joe Desmond
Brightsource s senior vice president of government affairs and
communications      It sprays vaporized grape skin extract  a mild
irritant  and emits sounds of natural predators near the tower to keep
birds away  he said  It has also developed algorithms to lessen the
convergence of rays from mirrors on standby  so the air does not get
as hot",2016-02-15,Reuters
242,Pratt   Whitney head says jet engine output risks easing,"By Tim Hepher SINGAPORE  Reuters    Pratt   Whitney s new chief says
the performance of suppliers is much better than year ago  easing
concerns over its ability to execute a  10 billion gamble on a new
engine as it seeks to reclaim a once revered status in the jet
industry  But the industry veteran said he knew how to find out
whether the company s make or break production goals for the latest
short haul airplane engine are under strain   I will get every engine
serial number and will see the parts that are committed and if it
supports the engine shipment date   Robert Leduc told Reuters at the
Singapore Airshow  Speaking after opening a high tech fan blade plant
in Singapore  Leduc also played down concerns over aircraft demand
saying the company had seen no deferrals or cancellations  Once
dominant in commercial aviation  Pratt lost its way in the 1990s after
betting on the wrong category of plane and leaving the door open to
General Electric   N GE  and its French partner  Safran   PA SAF   who
now lead sales by volume  It is seeking to regain its position with a
fuel efficient engine for jets including the Airbus  PA AIR  A320neo
as well as Canada s Bombardier  TO BBDb  and the latest model of
Embraer  Developed at a cost of  10 billion  the Geared Turbofan
engines claim to burn 15 percent less fuel and have already influenced
the way some future jet engines are designed  Pratt has sold 7 000 of
them and triggered other engine and plane developments  But analysts
warn the company still has much to prove as it attempts to increase
production seven fold in the next four years  When the previous
president stepped down earlier than expected last month after steering
through development  the boss of parent United Technologies  N UTX
named retired operations expert Leduc to take on the crucial early
production phase  It was the second time the no nonsense 59 year old
had been pulled out of retirement  Returning to Pratt   Whitney s
Connecticut offices on Jan  14  Leduc paid tribute to the advanced
design  but told senior staff   Now we ve got to execute and deliver
to our customers  Our reputation depends on it   according to a person
present  It plans to make 200 Geared Turbofans this year  roughly
doubling in 2017  That number will grow close to 1 400 by 2020  GE
Safran venture CFM International also has aggressive output plans  but
benefits from an existing supply chain  FIST FIGHTS OVER Both engine
makers are at the forefront of a record output drive that has
triggered concerns over the ability of weaker suppliers to keep up
Any slip ups could affect profit across the sector and Pratt must
additionally demonstrate it can execute on an all new civil project
for the first time in years   I have spent an inordinate amount of
time on this in the last four weeks  it was probably my number one
priority  digging into the industrial schedule   Leduc said  With  22
billion of long term supply agreements  or 85 percent of its needs now
in place  confidence in suppliers has risen in the past year  Leduc
said  That allows Pratt to focus most effort on the engines where
needed   We weren t managing that way last year   Leduc said   I think
every engine was a fist fight  we didn t have the fidelity around the
supplier  commitments  Now the design is stable  once  that happens
you give your operations a fighting chance to deliver   Even so  some
glitches need to be resolved  The Airbus A320neo missed an end 2015
target for first delivery after it emerged the engines needed longer
than usual to start properly  adding precious minutes to turnaround
times  A part was redesigned and will be followed by a software fix in
3 4 weeks  But the problem is an example of the slim margin for error
in the cut throat short haul airline market  Most modern jet engines
need 150 180 seconds to start up  Pratt s new engines currently need
closer to 350 seconds  By June the goal is to get this to 200 seconds
and by end year back to normal  a person familiar with the repair plan
said  The engines have also faced a problem with sophisticated control
software sending erroneous messages to the cockpit  adding extra
workload before the plane can take off  Engineers aim to eliminate 65
percent of the rogue messages by April and the rest by June  They are
not related to aircraft systems and don t present any safety risk
Leduc said  He said there had been no schedule delays since he took
the job last month  Industry sources have cited previous delays and
say Airbus is renegotiating some deliveries  Both firms say output
will be skewed towards the second half    I have got a fair amount of
confidence in what is going to happen  I think we have got enough
fidelity around our plants now and our investment and our supplier
commitments that we are confident that we are going to make this ramp
up   Leduc said",2016-02-15,Reuters

Siemens reported a 10 percent jump in industrial profit and its first
quarter of organic revenue growth in a year   We cannot make our
customers buy more but we can do more productivity in our company and
innovate more   Chief Executive Joe Kaeser told CNBC TV ahead of the
annual shareholder meeting  claiming success for a self help regime of
cuts and divestments  The results  which were also boosted by the weak
euro  were markedly more upbeat than those of U S  and Dutch rivals
General Electric   N GE  and Philips   Siemens now expects earnings
per share of 6 00 euros to 6 40 euros   6 50 to  6 94  for its
financial year through end September  up from its previous forecast of
5 90 to 6 20 euros  By 1105 GMT  6 05 a m  ET   Siemens shares were up
7 percent to 89 27 euros  their highest level since China led turmoil
took hold of global stock markets at the beginning of the year   The
robust industrial performance in the quarter has set Siemens up to be
one of the best performers this results season  We expect the stock to
outperform peers slightly   UBS analyst Fredric Stahl said  who rates
Siemens  buy   Siemens  performance was driven by its healthcare
transportation and energy management divisions   The Digital Factory
division  with whose help Siemens hopes to narrow a still yawning
profitability gap with GE  lost almost 2 percentage points from its
profit margin due to slowing demand from China  The business supports
manufacturers with a range of technologies   Transportation and energy
management won a series of large orders while Siemens  healthcare
division    like that of Philips    rebounded in China from a low base
a year ago  SOFTWARE EXPANSION Kaeser said Power and Gas margins would
likely hit a low this year  arguing that demand for oil would continue
to drive demand for Siemens  services even if depressed prices stymied
capital expenditure in the sector  Siemens widened its exposure to the
oil and gas markets with the ill timed  7 8 billion acquisition of U S
oil equipment maker Dresser Rand last year  Investors seem prepared to
look beyond the oil risk to see that Siemens is still relatively lowly
valued   at 12 6 times 12 month forward earnings  below GE s multiple
of 18 8 and Philips  14 0  according to Thomson Reuters data  Siemens
10 4 percent industrial profit margin last quarter was an improvement
but still far below GE s 18 3 percent  To boost margins and build on
its traditional strengths  Siemens is adding a software layer to its
electrification and automation operations  It announced on Monday
night it was buying U S  industrial software firm CD adapco for  970
million  the latest in a string of acquisitions in the area   Kaeser
said Siemens had seen a strong pickup in demand from China for such
factory software last quarter  amid a general environment of weak
spending on capital equipment that lopped 2 percentage points of its
Digital Factory unit profit margin",2016-01-26,Reuters

military machine over the past 30 years but is struggling to develop
advanced engines that would allow its warplanes to match Western
fighters in combat  foreign and Chinese industry sources said  The
country s engine technology lags that of United Technologies unit  N
UTX  Pratt   Whitney   General Electric   N GE  and Rolls Royce  L RR
said Douglas Barrie  senior fellow for military aerospace at the
International Institute for Strategic Studies in London  China s
Defence Ministry  in a brief statement to Reuters  said there was a
definite gap  between Chinese military technology and some developed
countries  adding Beijing would continue to strengthen its armed
forces  Western restrictions on arms exports to China prohibit the
sale of Western engines for military use  forcing China to rely on
homegrown designs or engines Russia has agreed to sell   Chinese
engine makers face a multitude of problems   said Michael Raska
assistant professor in the Military Transformations Programme at
Singapore s S  Rajaratnam School of International Studies  Among the
issues  China s J 20 and J 31 stealth fighters cannot super cruise  or
fly at supersonic speeds like their closest rivals  Lockheed Martin s
N LMT  F 22 and F 35 stealth planes  without using after burners  said
two industry sources who follow Beijing s military programs closely
After burners remove a warplane s stealthiness  a capability that
allows them to escape radar detection  Even the warplane engine that
experts consider to be China s best has reliability issues  said the
sources  who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of
the matter  SOUTH CHINA SEA A Chinese military expert  who has
knowledge of the government s defense policy but who declined to be
identified  said Chinese fighter jets could not perform as well as
American warplanes because of inferior engine technology  That puts
China at a disadvantage should its warplanes be pitted against U S
jet fighters or those from security ally Japan in Asia s disputed
waters  the industry sources and security experts said  Chinese
warplanes are likely to come into increasing contact with U S
fighters over the South China Sea in the years ahead after Beijing
conducted its first test flights this month to one of three island
runways it is building in the contested Spratly archipelago  security
experts said  In any conflict  China would likely rely on sheer
numbers of fighters as well as a growing arsenal of sophisticated
missiles that can be launched from warships or land  they added  To be
sure  China has made warplane engine development a priority in recent
years  sources said  The Shanghai based Galleon group  which provides
consulting services to the aerospace industry  estimates Beijing will
spend  300 billion over the next 20 years on civil and military
aircraft engine programs  Some sources said China had hired several
foreign engineers and former air force personnel to work on engine
development  although this could not be independently confirmed  The
Chinese Defence Ministry declined to comment   In 20 to 30 years time
given the amount of work they have done and the effort they are
putting into it  they should have a viable military engine   said Greg
Waldron  Asia Managing Editor at Flightglobal  an industry publication

from Russia in the 1950s  Its indigenous fighter jet program kicked
into full swing in the 1980s   The country s best warplane engine is
the WS 10A Taihang  made by Shenyang Aeroengine Research Institute  a
subsidiary of China s biggest state owned aerospace and defense

frequent repairs  added the sources   They are trying to improve the
Taihang  but reliability is a major problem   said one source  AVIC
did not respond to a request for comment while Shenyang Aeroengine
Research Institute could not be reached for comment   In October
state media said three engine makers owned by AVIC would merge into
one firm  China will do more to integrate other engine making firms in
the coming years  said a Chinese source in the country s aerospace
industry  This would help coordination across civilian and military
engine research and development and production  said the source  The
Defence Ministry declined to comment  To cover gaps for now  China has
fitted Russian engines on many of its warplanes  In November  China

won 2015 by aiming for brand name companies and avoiding the sector
bets that brought down biotech and energy investors  Now  as they look
ahead to 2016  these active investors expect to be even more defensive
picking companies like Hersheys Co and  General Electric   N GE  that
they say will be able to weather the combination of slow global growth
and the first U S  interest rate hike in a nearly decade   We re
looking for companies that have some competitive advantage that makes
them the standard in their industry   said Dennis Lynch  a co

Advantage fund  for instance  added positions in consumer companies
including Hershey   Estee Lauder  Companies Inc  N EL  and Colgate

companies with strong brands tend to withstand volatile markets  Lynch
said  At the same time  he trimmed positions in top holdings Amazon

performer in the large cap category   and Douglas Rao  portfolio
manager of the  2 4 billion Janus Forty fund    There s a lot of noise
and volatility in the market right now  and we re in the position of
trying to find companies that are less sensitive to the macro
environment   said Rao  Rao s fund gained 10 7 percent for the year
through Monday  a performance that was the 10th best among large cap
funds tracked by Lipper during a time when only 24 percent of large
cap funds have been able to outperform the 0 1 percent gain in the

came from his top holding  Google  O GOOGL  parent Alphabet Inc  which
has gained 44 percent for the year to date  and Amazon  which more
than doubled this year and accounts for his 8th largest position  Yet
Rao is not searching for the next stock to hit out the lights in 2016

246,GE moving headquarters to Boston to tap tech talent,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK  Reuters     General Electric   N GE  Co said
on Wednesday it will move its global headquarters to Boston  tapping
the city s technology talent as the industrial conglomerate seeks to
emphasize its digital capabilities  The maker of aircraft engines
locomotives  power turbines and household appliances will move to
temporary quarters by next summer  and permanently settle about 800
workers in the Seaport district by 2018  GE said   We want to be at
the center of an ecosystem that shares our aspirations  as a leader in
digital industrial activities  GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt said
in a statement   Greater Boston is home to 55 colleges and
universities  Massachusetts spends more on research and development
than any other region in the world  and Boston attracts a diverse
technologically fluent workforce focused on solving challenges for the
world   he added   We are excited to bring our headquarters to this
dynamic and creative city   GE said the move would have no material
financial impact  with costs offset by state and city incentives and
the sale of its current headquarters offices in Fairfield  Connecticut
and its offices at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City
Massachusetts will provide up to  120 million in grants and other
incentives and the city will provide property tax savings of up to  25
million  The state funds must be spent on public infrastructure
including site preparation  building acquisition costs and road and
building improvements  GE said  GE also is eligible for  1 million in
workforce training grants  and up to  5 million to foster relations
between the company  research institutions and universities  Boston
Mayor Martin Walsh said GE s decision resulted from  the city s
willingness and excitement to work creatively  to attract the company
bringing 800 high paying jobs to the city  Massachusetts has a
reputation for high taxes  but ranked 25th in a 2016 survey of
positive business tax climates of U S  states by the Tax Foundation  a
nonpartisan think tank  Connecticut ranked 44th  or near the bottom
This wasn t only about dollars and cents but what Boston and New
England brings to the table   said John Fish  chief executive officer
of Suffolk Construction Company  New England s largest building
company  LONG SEARCH GE s decision caps a search that intensified last
summer as Connecticut lawmakers passed a budget that increased taxes
by  1 2 billion over two years  drawing protests from some of the
state s biggest corporations   GE said on Wednesday it had been
thinking about a new location for more than three years  The company
said it considered 40 potential sites this year  Those included
Atlanta  Austin  Texas  and Nashville  Tennessee  according to people
familiar with the matter   The 124 year old company is undergoing a
major restructuring to emphasize digital and industrial capabilities
With 800 employees  the Boston headquarters will be about the same
size as Fairfield  but its composition will change  GE said  The new
office will have about 200 administration workers and 600  digital
industrial product managers  designs and developers   GE said  Those
workers  spread among the company s GE Digital  Current  robotics and
life sciences divisions  will share technology developments across
business units  GE said  helping develop software to run the machinery
the company manufacturers  GE had been based in Fairfield since 1974
The planned move is a blow to Connecticut  which in December reduced
corporate taxes to thwart criticism that the state is unfriendly to
business  Fairfield s 2013 2014 annual report listed GE s headquarters
with an assessed value  74 7 million and ranked it the city s largest
property taxpayer  GE has about 5 700 employees in Connecticut
including about 800 people employed at the Fairfield headquarters  It
was not immediately clear how many employees will remain in
Connecticut   GE s decision to relocate across the border to downtown
Boston is certainly disappointing  yet we remain a favored location
for companies to thrive   said Connecticut State Representative
Brendan Sharkey  GE s presence in the state had been shrinking because
much of it was related to its finance arm  GE Capital  The company is
selling off the bulk of GE Capital as part of its restructuring  Last
June  Immelt said in an email to employees that he asked a team to
examine the company s options to relocate the headquarters to a state
with a  more pro business environment   Earlier Wednesday  GE said it
would cut up to 6 500 jobs in Europe over the next two years
including 765 in France and 1 300 in Switzerland  as it restructures
and integrates its acquisition of Alstom s energy business    GE

247,GE doubles down on restructuring to combat slow growth,"By Alwyn Scott  Reuters     General Electric  Co  N GE  said on Friday
that it would double its 2016 budget for restructuring spending to
fight the effects of low oil prices and slow global growth that
pummeled its earnings last year  The U S  conglomerate plans to spend
3 4 billion on restructuring measures this year  double the  1 7
billion it targeted just last month  Chief Financial Officer Jeff
Bornstein said in an interview just hours after GE reported lower than
expected quarterly revenue   The company s shares were down 1 3
percent at  28 24 in afternoon trading after falling as much as 3 1
percent earlier in the session  Bornstein said the restructuring would
affect all of GE s diverse industrial units   with an emphasis on oil
and gas  operations  whose profit had tumbled 19 percent in the fourth
quarter   GE also plans to double cost reductions in the oil and gas
business  which supplies equipment to energy prospecting and
production companies  It is targeting as much  800 million in cuts in
2016  compared with an earlier goal of  400 million  Bornstein said
It cut  600 million in the business in 2015  The restructuring
measures include consolidating factory and service center real estate
improving supplier relationships  making plants more efficient and
reducing overhead and product costs   The emphasis on restructuring
comes as GE transforms itself into a digital industrial company
making complex machines and the software to run and monitor them  It
plans to move its global headquarters from Connecticut to Boston
which it said attracts a  technologically fluent  workforce  The
company plans to fund the increased restructuring actions with
proceeds from the  5 4 billion sale of its appliance business to China
s Haier Group  a deal announced last week  STUNG BY OIL PRICES  Oil
and gas results released on Friday showed the powerful effect of
falling energy prices   The drop in earnings at the unit pulled GE s
overall industrial profit down 8 percent to  5 52 billion  the company
said  GE expects oil and gas revenue to fall a further 10 percent to
15 percent in 2016 because of weak oil prices  Bornstein and Chief
Executive Officer Jeff Immelt told investors on a conference call
But restructuring and cost cutting should cushion the blow  Bornstein
said   Excluding special items  GE s total fourth quarter earnings of
52 cents a share beat the analysts  average estimate of 49 cents
according to Thomson Reuters I B E S  Revenue rose 1 4 percent to  33
89 billion  below analysts  expectations of  35 7 billion   Within the
oil and gas business  GE plans to speed up integrating the power
business it bought from  Alstom  SA of France  PA ALSO   a deal that
closed in November  It aims to accomplish in 2016 moves it had planned
for 2017 and 2018  GE also wants to increase industrial operating
profit in 2016 by 3 percent to just above  19 billion  excluding the
effects of the Alstom acquisition  Bornstein said  It is especially
focused on services sales and improving margins  The company recently
said it planned to cut as many as 6 500 jobs associated with the
Alstom purchase   In 2015  GE said it cut overhead costs by  800
million and realized about  1 billion in savings from prior
restructuring spending  That helped it boost its profit margin by
about 0 8 percent points  Bornstein said",2016-01-22,Reuters

249,Activist pressure helps reshape U S  corporates  from Yahoo to Dow  ,"By Michael Flaherty NEW YORK  Reuters    Activist investors are
building bigger stakes in bigger companies and their influence is
helping reshape the landscape of corporate USA       Merger
discussions between  Dow Chemical   N DOW  and DuPont  N DD   two of
the biggest and oldest names in the U S  chemical industry  were
prompted  at least in part  by activist investors  They also played a
role in Yahoo s  O YHOO  announcement to ditch the spinoff of its  32
billion stake in Chinese ecommerce giant  Alibaba   O BABA  in favor
of seeking the sale of its core Internet business      The penchant
for top tier activists to target large U S  companies is expected to
gain traction  as the funds have growing pots of money to spend and
need to put larger chunks of cash to work  Investors have poured more
money into activist hedge funds as successful campaigns to force
changes at hundreds of U S  companies have produced index beating
returns during the past few years   Activists played a direct role in
half of the 10 largest U S  mergers and acquisitions announced this
year  Thomson Reuters data show  in deals whose total combined value
topped  260 billion  In the prior four years combined  activists
played a role in only a handful of the top 10 M A deals  The move
toward bigger targets comes as the overall number of U S  activist
campaigns is set to surge past 400  data from research firm Activist
Insight data show  eclipsing last year s post financial crisis record
of 300 in a trend expected to continue into 2016   We re hearing from
a lot of activists  even first time activists  who are gearing up for

N M  too could face a proxy fight from Starboard Value LP   the firm
agitating at Yahoo   if the department store s turnaround plan fails
to take hold   Adding muscle to the activist buying spree is the
support of mutual and index funds  which are increasingly putting
aside their loyalty to CEOs and joining hands with activists who
promise to drive a stock higher   Last October  Starboard Value LP won
a standoff with Darden Restaurants Inc  N DRI   parent of the Olive

250,Russia annexed Crimea faces long road to power security,"By Anastasia Lyrchikova and Alexander Winning MOSCOW  Reuters    The
Kremlin is trying to reassure residents of Crimea  left in the dark
after electricity supplies from Ukraine were cut off  that it is
coming to their rescue by installing a power link with Russia  But the
reality is that it will take many months of complex engineering before
Russia can provide Crimea with a secure electricity supply  while
Western sanctions over the peninsula s annexation have made it more
difficult to buy the best equipment for the job  The electricity
problems are a stark reminder that when Vladimir Putin last year
decided to make Crimea part of Russia he was not just courting
international outcry but also taking on huge practical problems about
how to sustain a peninsula that is physically cut off from Russia
Crimea was plunged into darkness around three weeks ago after
electricity pylons in southern Ukraine that carry the four lines that
supply Crimea with the bulk of its power were blown up by unidentified
people  The authorities in Ukraine  where anger over the annexation
last year is still raw  have shown little urgency in restoring the
power supplies  Russia has flown in emergency generators that cover
some of Crimea s power needs  and Ukraine has partially restored power
But until Crimea is fully hooked up to the Russian grid  it will be
vulnerable to power disruptions  Moscow s response has been to speed
up work on a so called  energy bridge    a series of cables along the
seabed   it is building across the Kerch Strait that separates Russia
from Crimea  That project was launched by Putin on a visit to Crimea
on Dec  2  but its transmission capacity remains limited and Russian
officials have largely glossed over the huge engineering challenges
the remaining work will entail   The issue is really pressured  The
energy bridge is not just an underwater cable  you see   said Sergei
Pikin  director of Russian consultancy Energy Development Fund   It s
difficult work that normally takes years to complete   ENERGY BRIDGE
Russia has hired a Chinese firm  Hengtong  to supply the power cables
to be laid across the Kerch Strait  a source at a Western electrical
corporation said  Russia s Kommersant newspaper also reported the
Chinese firm was supplying the cables  The Western source also noted
however  that Chinese companies have much less experience in this
field than those cut off from the project due to sanctions  The
previous time Russia laid an undersea cable for such a project  in
2011 between the Pacific port of Vladivostok and the island of Russky
it contracted a Japanese firm to supply the cable  A French company
supplied the cable for a link under Lake Baikal in Siberia  completed
in 2005  Hengtong did not respond to questions submitted by Reuters
about its role in the project  Russia s Energy Ministry declined to
say who was supplying the cables  If everything goes to plan  by June
next year all the cables planned for the energy bridge will be laid
850 Megawatts is what it will be possible to send via the energy
bridge from May 2016  without any risk to the energy system of the
south of Russia   Deputy Energy Minister Andrei Cherezov told Reuters
That should allow Crimea to plug its electricity deficit with supplies
from Russia  according to Vladimir Sklyar  director for utilities
research at Renaissance Capital  But the challenges don t end with the
undersea cables  Russia must also build electricity substations and
lay new transmission lines on either side of the Kerch Strait to
connect the new cables to the existing networks  Analysts say that
because Crimea s power has always come from the north  via a
neighboring Ukrainian region  its grid is set up to handle north to
south flows  and now will have to be re configured to take in power
from the east  Work must be done too on the Russian side of the bridge
to ensure there is sufficient spare capacity in the southern portion
of Russia s grid to supply power to Crimea   E ON Russia   MM EONR
controlled by German firm E ON  DE EONGn   said on Thursday it was
interested in building generating capacity in the Krasnodar region
which Russian authorities have said could be used to send power to
Crimea  Maxim Shirokov  E ON Russia s head  told journalists   It will
supply electricity to the wholesale market      The same thing that we
re doing at the moment  Therefore I don t see any risks linked to this
ENDURING SOLUTION Experts say power stations in Crimea itself offer a
more enduring solution to the peninsula s energy needs  Russia plans
to build these near Crimea s capital Simferopol and Sevastopol  home
to its Black Sea fleet  The first blocks at those stations are due to
come online in September 2017  and their generating capacity is to be
doubled to around 940 Megawatts the following year  That will ensure
Crimea is self sufficient and can use the bridge as backup or during
times of peak consumption  when around 1 3 Gigawatts of electricity
are needed  But the power plants are some way from being completed
and sourcing machinery could present problems  With a few exceptions
Russian firms do not produce the powerful gas turbines often installed
in Russian power stations  Such turbines are usually bought from
Germany s  Siemens   DE SIEGn   France s  Alstom   PA ALSO  and
General Electric   N GE  of the United States  Alstom said it had
received no requests to supply equipment to Crimea and declined to
comment on whether it was prepared to deliver supplies there  Siemens
did not respond to a request for comment  and GE declined comment  If
those suppliers were to sign contracts to provide equipment for power
stations in Crimea  they run the risk of violating sanctions  Finding
an alternative solution is liable to be time consuming and expensive
On top of that would be the challenges of upgrading a power network
that was already creaking after years of under investment from Kiev
There is several years  work to bring the system into a good  stable
condition   a source in Russia s utilities sector said   No one has
managed such a task over the past 50 60 years  Of course it won t be
easy",2015-12-13,Reuters

prime minister is expected to promote deals for Russian nuclear
reactors and military helicopters worth billions of dollars on a trip
to Moscow next week  attracted by promises to transfer technology that
Western nations have been slow to make  Russia and India will
manufacture 200 Kamov 226T helicopters in a joint venture  a Russian
and an Indian government official said  in the first big step for
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi s campaign to build a domestic
industrial base and reduce the military s dependence on expensive
imports  Modi  who heads for Moscow on Dec  23  will also offer Russia
a site in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh to build six nuclear
reactors of 1 200 megawatts  MW  each  the same sources added  That is
in addition to the six Russia is constructing in neighboring Tamil
Nadu state  said the officials  who spoke on condition of anonymity
because they were not authorized to speak to the press  New Delhi has
turned to Russia as U S  firm  General Electric   N GE  and
Westinghouse  a U S  based unit of Japan s Toshiba  are still weighing
an entry into India s nuclear energy sector because of a law that
makes reactor suppliers liable in case of an accident  Modi s  Make in
India  push for a military that has been the world s biggest importer
for the last four years has also made little headway  with
negotiations stalled over issues including technology transfer and the
local assembly of equipment  For Russia  India offers an alternative
fast growing outlet for its exports as sanctions imposed by the West
squeeze the economy   While others are making promises  Russia is
moving forward with the Make in India program   the Russian government
source said  RUSSIA LET DOMINANCE SLIP Moscow  which has maintained
close ties with India since the Cold War  has in recent years slipped
behind the United States and Israel in securing orders in the Indian
defense market  estimated to be worth  130 billion over the next seven
years  Now Russian President Vladimir Putin is banking on India s
drive to manufacture at home to regain market share   The objective is
that whatever we do with Russia  that will have a  Make in India
component   said Amitabh Kant  the top Indian bureaucrat leading the
push to turn India into a global manufacturing base  Under an inter
government agreement to be signed during Modi s trip  Moscow will set
up a production line for the light helicopters that will supply the
Indian military but also eventually Russia  the Russian official said
India s state run Hindustan Aeronautics and Anil Ambani s Reliance
Defence are in the running as local partners for the deal for the 200
twin engined helicopters  estimated at  1 billion  to replace India s
aging fleet of Cheetah and Chetak helicopters   The choice of the
Indian partner has been left to the Indian government  We will work
with anyone the government nominates   the official said  India is
also turning to Russia to secure overseas energy assets to help fuel
its economy  Indian Oil Corp and Oil India  both state owned  are in
talks with Russia s Rosneft to buy up to a 29 percent stake in a
Siberian oil project  two sources said on Friday  RUSSIA HAS THE
ADVANTAGE The helicopter deal would be the first major contract under
Modi s drive to build weapons at home that has excited local defense
companies but failed to deliver any significant tenders  As some
Indian manufacturers look to Western firms for the tie ups needed to
bring in technology and build locally  Reliance is forging closer ties
with Russia to jumpstart its nascent bid to develop a defense business
from scratch  A Reliance executive  who asked not to be named  said
negotiations to win the joint helicopter venture would not start until
the two governments had agreed the deal  Hindustan Aeronautics did not
respond to a request for comment  A source close to Rosoboronexport
Russia s state owned arms exporter  said India would produce 140 of
the choppers and Russia the remaining 60  Pre contract work is
underway and the two sides expect to clarify the agreement during Modi
s visit  the source said  An Indian government official confirmed the
plan to sign the helicopter deal as well as the proposed offer of
Andhra Pradesh as the location of the next set of reactors to be built
by Russian state owned nuclear firm Rosatom  The two sides have not
given any value for the deal  Rosatom spokesman Sergey Novikov said
there were no plans yet to sign any contracts during Modi s visit
Nandan Unnikrishnan  an expert on India Russia relations at the
Observer Research Foundation  said that despite New Delhi s tilt
toward the West for military hardware in recent years  Russia retained
an edge in many areas   Russia has a distinct advantage over everyone
in understanding how Indian bureaucracy works  given the level of
trust that exists in the Indian establishment vis a vis Russia   he

253,Buffett s BNSF helped lead fight to delay train safety technology,"By David Morgan and Nick Carey WASHINGTON  Reuters    When an Amtrak
passenger train derailed in Philadelphia in May  killing eight people
and injuring scores more  the railroad industry s campaign to delay a
Dec  31 deadline to install technology to prevent such disasters
appeared to be finished  Not  as it turned out  if billionaire
investor Warren Buffett and Sen  John Thune  a South Dakota Republican
had anything to do with it  Thune chairs the Senate Commerce Committee
which oversees the rail industry   Last week  under pressure from
companies including Buffett s BNSF Railway Co  which has spent more
money lobbying Congress this year than any other railroad  U S
legislators passed  and President Obama signed  a law that delays the
so called positive train control mandate for at least three years
with the possibility of an additional two year delay  That means
railroad operators can put off having to buy and install equipment
that safety advocates say would have prevented accidents that have
claimed more than 245 lives and caused over 4 200 injuries since the
National Transportation Safety Board began calling for the technology
in 1969   Railroad advocates presented a blunt argument  Unless the
mandate to install positive train control technology was delayed  the
railroads would attempt to cripple the economy  Railroads that missed
the deadline to install systems that automatically slow or stop a
train under dangerous circumstances claimed that they would face
heightened liabilities by operating outside of federal law  and that
therefore they would decline to carry passengers  including commuters
They wouldn t deliver commodities that are classified as hazardous
but are also vital to the economy   including chemicals like chlorine
and ammonia needed to run city water treatment plants  refine oil and
keep farms and factories running  BNSF  at  3 9 million  was the
biggest spender among individual rail operators as railroads and
allies including unions and regional transit authorities spent almost
25 million lobbying Congress on PTC and other issues  according to
Senate documents   BNSF  along with  Norfolk Southern  Corp  N NSC
and Canadian Pacific Railway  referred questions for comment to the
Association of American Railroads    We commend Congress for passing
the extension   said AAR spokesman Ed Greenburg   We have been warning
for years that the deadline was unworkable because the technology had
to be developed from scratch   Railroads have spent  6 billion on PTC
up to now and expect to spend another  4 billion before implementation
is complete  according to the AAR   Opponents of the deal  including
Senators Diane Feinstein of California  Chuck Schumer of New York  Ed
Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut  all
Democrats  found themselves outmaneuvered by the rail industry  aided
by Thune and a regulator s favorable interpretation of an obscure law
It is entirely inappropriate that the railroad industry would make
hostages of America s passenger rail services and chemical shippers in
order to secure their favored legislative outcome   Feinstein said in
a statement for the Congressional Record   It is offensive that only
when a railroad could face full liability for an accident that they
find operation without PTC to be unacceptably dangerous    LOBBYING
Lobbying by shippers and other interests  including the U S  Chamber
of Commerce  drove total spending to almost  113 million over the
course of the year  Records show that lobby spending jumped from about
18 5 million in the first quarter to  70 million in the third quarter
as the push intensified   Thune said he realized early on that the New
Year s Eve deadline could have dire consequences for the economy and
for railroads  which were reporting problems with positive train
control systems   But after May s Amtrak disaster   when they
announced that this could have been prevented if they d had positive
train control  there was a real spotlight on why we weren t there and
what we could do to get there faster   Thune told Reuters in an
interview  Meanwhile  the railroads were hampered by anti trust
considerations that prohibited operators from talking directly with
each other to launch a collaborative effort   That changed in August
after Thune sent letters to the regulatory Surface Transportation
Board and individual railroads asking what would happen if the PTC
deadline was not extended  His committee then publicized their
responses    That was sort of the seminal moment   Thune said  Now the
railroads had a channel for their views   Then on Sept  3  Surface
Transportation Board Chairman Daniel Elliott wrote a letter to Thune
stating that railroads could be exempt from their federal obligation
to provide service to shippers due to issues involving safety  The
board is an economic regulatory agency charged by Congress with
resolving railroad rate and service disputes and reviewing proposed
railroad mergers   Less than a week later  major U S  and Canadian
railroads including BNSF  Norfolk Southern and Canadian Pacific began
informing Thune that Congress  failure to act on a PTC extension would
lead to crippling disruptions for shippers and rail passengers
beginning Jan  1    Everybody thought they were hyping this or
overreacting   Thune said  Then letters started coming in from
shippers  farmers and cities alarmed by the potential disruptions
Railroad executives also raised the issue in quarterly calls with
investors  Soon  members of Congress were hearing from a host of
industries    automakers  oil companies  high tech firms  farmers
water treatment facilities and even the makers of bullet proof vests
The American Chemistry Council  the National Association of
Manufacturers and the U S  Chamber of Commerce weighed in on the
railroads  behalf   Household names and giant employers including
Exxon Mobil   N XOM    Chevron   N CVX   Cisco Systems  O CSCO
General Electric   N GE   Cargill Inc and Land O  Lakes joined the
fray    I started having members coming up to me and saying  What are
we going to do about this and how are we going to fix this  Democrats
and Republicans   Thune said   That left it to four members of
Congress   all of them big beneficiaries of rail industry campaign
contributions   to work out a deal that could win bipartisan support
in both the Senate and the House of Representatives  They then pushed
to attach it to a must pass short term extension to the Highway Trust
Fund  The four were Thune and the Senate Commerce Committee s top
Democrat Bill Nelson of Florida  the House Transportation Committee s
Republican chairman Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania and that panel s top
Democrat  Peter DeFazio of Oregon   Together  the four have received
1 2 million rail industry campaign contributions during their Capitol
Hill careers  with about two thirds of that sum going to the two
Republicans  according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive
Politics    The measure passed both chambers on simple voice votes
that meant individual lawmakers didn t have their positions recorded
Supporters said that showed near universal support for the measure",2015-11-04,Reuters

256,Valeant s looming M A hiatus deals blow to investment banks,"By Carl O Donnell NEW YORK  Reuters    The controversy surrounding
Valeant Pharmaceuticals   N VRX  strategy and its market slide this
week are bad news for Wall Street investment banks that stand to lose
one of their best clients  The specialty drug company has emerged as
the fifth largest payer of investment banker fees over the past three
years thanks to its rapid acquisition driven and debt financed
expansion that has made it a darling of investors  But its business
model  which has also relied on aggressive price hikes for acquired
drugs  has come under growing scrutiny because of political backlash
against high drug prices  dragging Valeant shares down from record
highs scaled in August  The company said earlier this week it would
now focus on buying back shares and paying off debt after spending
about  40 billion on some 150 acquisitions since 2008 only to see its
shares plummet further after a short selling firm raised questions
about its strategy and accounting practices   The firm s woes mean a
likely loss of lucrative business for JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM
Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  N GS  and other major investment banks
Since 2012  only  General Electric  Co  N GE   Allergan Plc  N AGN
AT T Inc  N T  and Dell Inc have paid more than Valeant in fees to
Wall Street  according to data from Freeman and Co  a consulting firm
Valeant s investment banking fees totaled  500 million since 2012
according to Freeman  JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have been top
beneficiaries  pocketing  97 million and  84 million respectively in
the last three years    Morgan Stanley   N MS    Deutsche Bank  AG  DE
DBKGn  and RBC Capital Markets  TO RBC  each earned roughly  50
million  according to the data   The handsome fee payments have come
even though Valeant has closed a number of its largest deals without
hiring a mergers and acquisitions adviser  including its largest
acquisition  the  15 8 billion takeover of Salix Pharmaceuticals in
April   In going alone in some deals  Valeant relied on the deal
making expertise of its top executives  Its Chief Executive Michael
Pearson   L PSON   previously led the pharmaceutical practice at
McKinsey   Co   and Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller  who left
the company in June  was a top investment banker at Goldman Sachs
Valeant still paid fees for the financing of the deals  Valeant s
capital raising  mostly in the form of debt  has been by far the most
lucrative source of deal making fees  accounting for nearly  450
million of the total  according to the data   For Valeant  the legacy
of those capital raises is more than  40 billion in debt  which
currently exceeds its market capitalization of around  39 billion
Several other drug companies that have followed similar strategies of
aggressive acquisitions  cuts in research and development budgets and
price increases  have also come under pressure amid concerns about
tougher drug pricing scrutiny   Several Valeant peers  including Endo
International Plc  O ENDP    Mallinckrodt  Plc  N MNK  and  Horizon
Pharma  Plc  O HZNP   have also seen their shares fall  potentially
limiting their ability to make acquisitions in the future",2015-10-23,Reuters

to hire engineers  data scientists  operations staff  and customer
service professionals as it builds up its online lending business
according to people contacted by the bank and online job postings
The most powerful bank on Wall Street has made a series of key hires
as it muscles into the consumer lending business  where it hopes to
use technology to compete against traditional lenders and startups
Those hires include former  Citigroup  Inc  N C  credit card executive
David Stark  who will serve as the business s chief risk officer
according to Stark s LinkedIn profile  It has also taken in former
Lending Club Corp  N LC  operations executive Darin Cline to lead
operations  as well as employees from  American Express  Co   N AXP
according to their LinkedIn profiles   Other hires include Dustin Cohn
who will head up branding for the new unit  Cohn was the former
marketing officer at underwear and sleepwear company Jockey
International  and he also helped develop brand campaigns for Gatorade
and Pizza Hut at PepsiCo   N PEP  Goldman has also hired Boe Hartman
a former executive at  Barclays  PLC s  L BARC  Barclaycard division
Goldman in May said it had hired the head of Discover Financial
Services   N DFS  U S  cards division Harit Talwar to lead its new
online lending effort  which will be focused on making unsecured loans
both to consumers and to small and medium businesses using deposits
The unit will lend out money from Goldman s banking unit  rather than
lending money from individual investors the way Lending Club does  and
is expected to launch sometimes in 2016   The investment bank s effort
to build a lending business is the latest example of how Wall Street
stalwarts like Goldman Sachs and  Morgan Stanley   N MS  are
reinventing themselves after the financial crisis in an effort to make
themselves safer  Morgan Stanley has been building up its retail
brokerage business  which generates more stable revenue than trading
operations  Goldman s efforts so far have been more modest  but it has
agreed to buy  General Electric   N GE  Capital s U S  online deposit
platform and is building its online lending business  Deposits can
offer stable funding in times of crisis  Lending Club and Citi
declined to comment on departures   Goldman has reached out to
engineers and data scientists for the team  according to people
contacted by the firm who could not give more detail because they were
required to sign non disclosure agreements before they were allowed to
interview at Goldman   The bank is also looking to hire for operations
and customer service positions in Salt Lake City  its second largest U
S  office outside its 200 West Street headquarters in New York
according to job listings on LinkedIn   The online lending group will
initially be built up within Goldman s merchant banking division
although its formal organizational structure has not yet been
finalized    A spokesman for Goldman declined to comment on the bank s

260,GE set for cost cuts as EU decision on Alstom deal nears ,"By Lewis Krauskopf  Reuters     General Electric   NYSE GE  Co is
expected to win regulatory approval next week for its purchase of the
power equipment business of France s  Alstom   PARIS ALSO   allowing
the U S  industrial conglomerate to finally carry out a major cost
cutting program 16 months after first announcing the deal  The
European Commission has set a Sept  11 deadline to decide on the
roughly  13 5 billion deal  the biggest acquisition ever for GE  which
will bring together two of the world s largest manufacturers of power
plant hardware   European regulators have expressed concerns over the
combined company s control of the gas turbine market  GE has not
disclosed what changes it has agreed to make to win clearance from
European competition regulators  In May  GE told investors it expects
3 billion in cost reductions over the next five years as it combines
its operations with those of Alstom  more than double the previous
target when the deal was first announced in April 2014   GE has also
projected the deal would add 15 to 20 cents per share to earnings in
2018  or nearly 10 percent of GE s overall profit expected that year
by Wall Street  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S    To hit those
goals  GE will consolidate manufacturing operations  cut duplicated
overheads  and make savings on purchasing expenses  according to GE
presentations on the deal  But to gain the blessing of the French
government last year  GE committed to add 1 000 jobs in the country
possibly handcuffing the conglomerate s ability to reap savings from
Alstom s home base  Outside of France  GE said last year that 18 000
of Alstom s 65 000 total employees involved in the deal worked in
Europe  where works councils can make job cuts difficult   The
challenges in making it work is you re buying a huge European centric
organization  and history has said it s hard to get synergies in

global industrials fund  adding that he still thinks GE will be able
to pull off the integration  GE is also in the middle of its own cost
cutting plans  which aim to reduce industrial sales and administrative
expenses to 12 percent of revenue  from just under 16 percent in 2013
while improving gross margin by about 0 5 percentage points in 2015
and 2016  Meanwhile  GE has stressed the benefits of having Alstom as
part of its operations  The French company has a strong franchise in
steam turbines and sells equipment GE has previously lacked  such as
heat recovery steam generators  Those are needed for  combined cycle
power plants that increase efficiency by using both gas and steam
turbines  Such plants are expected to account for more than 70 percent
of future gas turbine purchases  GE said last year  GE also stands to
profit from servicing Alstom made equipment  RBC Capital Markets
analyst Deane Dray says service revenue could be the  jewel  of the
deal  noting that GE s service margins for thermal equipment are
nearly twice those of Alstom s   GE still has obstacles to climb
Sluggish global economic growth could temper power demand in the near
term  especially in emerging markets  and undercut revenue prospects
Meanwhile  Alstom s financial performance has weakened as the deal has
been reviewed  with sales in its energy business down 7 percent and
orders down 12 percent in its most recent fiscal year    Even with
some top line risk  they should be able to make the deal work based on
the cost synergies   UBS analyst Shannon O Callaghan said",2015-09-04,Reuters
261,Businesses hail Renzi s reforms  urge more to speed Italy s upturn,"By Silvia Aloisi and Elvira Pollina CERNOBBIO  Italy  Reuters    U S
computer company Hewlett Packard  N HPQ  is considering increasing
investments and hiring new workers in Italy after years of downsizing
because  it says  it has faith  for the first time in a while  that
the country is on the mend   There is a lot still to be done  but the
glass now is looking half full   said Stefano Venturi  the group s
corporate vice president and its chief executive in Italy  where it
has three data centers and 5 000 employees  His words echoed the
cautious optimism in the air at an annual forum of corporate and
financial leaders that has long been a barometer of the nation s
business mood   A fledgling economic recovery after the longest post
war recession is giving companies cause for hope  while Prime Minister
Matteo Renzi says his ongoing reform agenda is helping turn around the
euro zone s third largest economy   Over the past 18 months  Renzi has
tackled the labor market  the banking sector  education and the public
administration  among other areas  even though few reforms are yet
operational and their long term impact remains to be seen  Renzi
turned up at the meeting to reel off his achievements in a speech
followed by two hours of questions from foreign and domestic
participants on the future of Italy   All the executives said there
was much more to be done to bring Italy s growth in line with the rest
of Europe  tackle stifling bureaucracy and corruption  speed up the
justice system  cut taxes and keep control of tottering public
finances  But the overall atmosphere was in sharp contrast to last
year s gloomy discussions over the crisis and impatience at the lack
of progress  and an internal poll showed 69 percent of participants
had an excellent or good assessment of Renzi   My view of the
government is very positive  Italy is out of the recession and for the
first time in I don t how many years they are talking of raising the
growth forecast   said Federico Ghizzoni  CEO of top Italian bank
UniCredit  MI CRDI      Italy s growth estimate of 0 7 percent this
year is below the European Union average  while Renzi s government has
so far failed to cut a huge public debt of 2 trillion euros  BROKEN
TABOOS EU authorities and the International Monetary Fund still say
Italy is too slow in making structural reforms to tackle what they see
as the asphyxiating influence of vested interests from unions and
professional groups to taxi drivers   Renzi  who last year skipped the
Ambrosetti conference on the shores of Lake Como to visit instead a
hydraulic equipment plant  this time turned up to boast about his
accomplishments and promise more reforms in the next 2 1 2 years
before elections     Italy is no longer a problem for Europe   he said
adding that during his tenure 25 percent of the nearly 1 million jobs
lost during the crisis had been recovered     He said this was thanks
to his labor market reform which eased firing restrictions and offered
temporary tax breaks for companies that hire workers on permanent
contracts     Though economists say it is way too early to tell is his
Jobs Act  is having any impact on unemployment  entrepreneurs praised
Renzi for taking on trade unions and other lobby groups  changing the
perception of Italy as a country impervious to change   He s done
things in 18 months that weren t done in the past 40 years  He s
broken taboos   on jobs  banks  the justice system   said Venturi
For foreign investors like us  50 percent of the decision to invest
money in a country depends on the credibility of its leaders  There s
faith he can take Italy out of the doldrums     Sandro De Poli  CEO
and Chairman of  General Electric   N GE  in Italy and Israel  said
Renzi was  at least a straight talker who gets to the point and
explains how he plans to reach his goals      In his speech  Renzi
said the business world should also change its ways and that the days
of the  salotto buono    a system based on influence and connections
that has bound top Italian companies together for decades   were over",2015-09-06,Reuters

263,Exporters run for high ground as China growth story unravels ,"By Georgina Prodhan FRANKFURT  Reuters    The alarming scale of China
s economic slowdown is pushing European exporters to accelerate a move
into premium goods and services  sacrificing volumes if necessary to
sustain margins  As Chinese rivals gain expertise in areas from
elevators to healthcare to sweeteners while unexpectedly weak demand
exposes yet more unneeded supply  prices are falling even in areas
foreign suppliers thought were insulated from local competition  A
Chinese interest rate cut and loosening of bank lending restrictions
this week designed to boost lending to Chinese businesses underscored
Beijing s determination to stimulate local consumption and production
The move  on the heels of a surprise yuan devaluation two weeks ago
has further unnerved investors who bought into the growth stories of
European exporters dependent on China  German industrial group
ThyssenKrupp  DE TKAG   Dutch healthcare and consumer group Philips
AS PHG  and British food ingredients group Tate   Lyle  L TATE  are
among those adjusting for lower growth and a new intensity in price
wars   The message which we have given the team in China is the
following  You need to move up your margin   ThyssenKrupp Chief
Executive Heinrich Hiesinger told analysts this month  referring to
the group s elevator business  its most profitable unit   If they have
the risk that the growth or the market would force that margin going
down  then they would get the message  Be more selective  because we
do not want you to dilute   ThyssenKrupp depends on China for 16
percent of sales at its elevator unit  which makes both high end lifts
and escalators for commercial buildings and mass market elevators for
residential property  where the market is coming out of a slump  In
the midst of the market turmoil on Wednesday ThyssenKrupp said it was
increasing its stake in a joint elevators venture that caters mainly
for the Chinese market  MANAGING THE MIX As Chinese national champions

world s biggest market by new installations   As a sales market  you
will have to look at other regions   he said  Solar power  too   a key
strategic industry for China   is a closed shop for foreign suppliers

electricity  Chinese suppliers dominate the market  A rise in Chinese
competition has sometimes come from unexpected quarters  Tate   Lyle
is refocusing its sucralose artificial sweetener business on customers
that care about quality  safety and provenance more than price after
prices were hammered by a glut of cheaper product from China  Late
last year  Tate   Lyle forecast sucralose prices would fall 25 percent
year on year as it had to renegotiate supply contracts at lower prices
to protect share from Chinese rivals  In July  it said it was
managing the mix between volume and margin very  very carefully right

The big question is now what happens in healthcare equipment
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER Healthcare is a key area in which China wants to
promote its homegrown medical devices and create incentives for
medical institutions to use locally made products  Beijing wants to
reduce soaring healthcare costs while improving the health of its 1 4
billion people  The medical equipment devices market  worth an
estimated 212 billion yuan   33 billion  in 2013  is dominated by
foreign players such as  Siemens   DE SIEGn    General Electric   N GE
Philips  AS PHG  and Toshiba  T 6502    We see the market slowdown
Obviously  we also see there the emergence of local competitors that
nibble at the market share    and I think that is what all major
companies will have to reckon with   Philips CEO Frans van Houten said
last month  Chinese providers like Mindray Medical International  N MR
and China Resources Wandong Medical Equipment Co  Ltd  SS 600055  are
mainly making their presence felt in simpler imaging devices such as
ultrasound machines so far  But with technology transfer thanks to
joint ventures that most foreign firms set up to produce in China
foreign suppliers cannot hope to keep indefinitely their ownership of
the market for high end computed tomography or magnetic resonance
imaging  Most foreign firms with significant Chinese operations have
such joint ventures  certain industries like automaking require them
while other companies see JVs as a way to local market knowledge

264,Google morphs into Alphabet  investors cheer clarity,"By Mari Saito and Julia Love SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters     Google Inc   O
GOOGL  announced a surprise overhaul of its operating structure on
Monday  creating a holding company called Alphabet to pool its many
subsidiaries and separate the core web advertising business from newer
ventures like driverless cars  The move appeared to be an attempt by
the search engine giant to focus on its more creative and ambitious
projects  while investors cheered the potential for more financial
disclosures of its disparate business segments    It suggests that in
all likelihood  Google is not going to slow the pace of their
experimental processes like self driving cars   said Michael Yoshikami
head of Destination Wealth Management  which has  1 5 billion under
management  The surprise news sent shares of Google up as much as 7
percent to  708 in after hours trading  The new structure could also
give Wall Street better insight into Google s investment in moonshot
projects like Google X  a secretive lab that produced the unpopular
Google Glass wearable device    They are aware that they ve got this
hodgepodge of companies   said Roger Kay  an analyst at Endpoint
Technologies Associates   Maybe it s better to sort them out a bit and
make it clearer which ones are bringing in the bacon and which ones
are science projects and which ones are long term bets    The Mountain
View based company co founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998
has grown from an Internet search engine to a far reaching
conglomerate that employs more than 40 000 people worldwide   Google s
planned structure resembles the way companies like Berkshire Hathaway
N BRKa  and  General Electric   N GE  are organized  with a central
unit handling corporate wide activities such as finance and relatively
independent business units focused on specific areas  Under the new
corporate structure  the Google unit will encompass the core search
engine as well Google Maps and YouTube  In addition to Google X  the
company s new ventures such as Calico  which focuses on longevity  and
connected home products maker Nest will be managed separately  Other
units that are part of the new structure include Fiber  for its high
speed Internet efforts  venture capital arm Google Ventures  and
Google Capital  which invests in larger tech companies   NEW STRUCTURE
Alphabet Inc will replace Google as the publicly traded entity and all
shares of Google will automatically convert into the same number of
shares of Alphabet  with all the same rights    This new structure
will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary
opportunities we have inside of Google   Page  the current CEO of
Google  said in a blogpost     Page will become CEO of Alphabet
Analysts said the new structure could herald a new era of fiscal
discipline and transparency in some of Google s more experimental and
opaque business units   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission  Google said the new arrangement will take effect later
this year and that it will likely result in two reportable  financial
segments    For example  if a unit is doing well or badly they can
dial it up or down  they can form partnerships or different companies
said Kay of Endpoint Technologies  Some other analysts were cautious
saying the new holding company would need to provide more details on
cash flow of the experimental business segments    Breaking up into
two different segments   well  it s not a terrible thing  It s better
than not doing it but on the other hand  you re going to have a ton of
businesses buried inside of a legacy Google   said Brian Wieser  an
analyst for Pivotal Research Group   The shuffle also looked to have
the markings of Ruth Porat  who joined Google as its chief financial
officer in March from  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   In Google s recent
quarterly conference call  Porat  will serve as CFO of both Alphabet
and Google  repeatedly emphasized keeping expenses under control  With
Page heading up Alphabet  Sundar Pichai  a long time Google executive
who most recently served as the company s senior vice president of
products  will head Google  Pichai  a well liked executive who oversaw
Google s Android and Chrome units  is respected in Silicon Valley for
attracting top engineers   Google co founder Brin will become
president of Alphabet  and Eric Schmidt  chairman of Google  will be
executive chairman  The company s current directors will become
directors of Alphabet  Analysts said the move could be followed by
more structural changes in the future     This may be step one of
several steps   said Morningstar analyst Rick Summer",2015-08-11,Reuters
265,GE Capital CEO sees asset sale pace speeding up in third quarter,"By Lewis Krauskopf  Reuters    The head of  General Electric  Co s  N
GE  finance unit said Tuesday he expects the pace of GE Capital asset
sales will accelerate in the third quarter as the U S  conglomerate
eyes unloading an even bigger chunk of assets   We re going to pick up
the pace in the third quarter   GE Capital Chief Executive Keith
Sherin told Reuters in an interview   GE  which is shedding  200
billion in finance assets to focus on industrial manufacturing
earlier on Tuesday announced the  2 2 billion sale of its European
private equity financing business to Japan s Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp  A day earlier  GE said it had agreements to shed its fleet
management arm  A deal to sell its U S  private equity lending
business was disclosed earlier in the month  Analysts have said the
finance asset sales have garnered high deal prices so far  but it
remains to be seen if future sales will realize the same value and
allow GE to reap more than the  35 billion in proceeds it has targeted
for share buybacks  A hefty portion of the businesses that have yet to
be sold are part of GE s North American commercial lending and leasing
portfolio  Overall  GE s North American units are  highly coveted
Sherin said   Globally  we have strong businesses but they re not as
strong as some of these North American franchises   he said  All told
since April 10 GE Capital has announced asset sales totaling  23
billion in ending net investment  GE s measure of assets that excludes
non interest bearing liabilities  With the most recent deals  GE hit a
target of announcing  20 billion to  30 billion in asset sales during
the second quarter   We re going to have more announcements in the
third quarter  and it will be more than we had in the second quarter
Sherin said  Sherin confirmed that meant exceeding  23 billion in
second quarter announced deals  but did not give a specific target
Sherin reaffirmed GE s earlier goal to close deals for  100 billion in
assets this year  The company has announced buyers for  68 billion in
assets thus far  GE had prioritized the sale of three businesses
Sherin said last month  of which only healthcare financial services
remained without an announced buyer  An agreement for that business
which lends to private equity in healthcare as well as provides real
estate loans to operators of assisted living facilities  is  in the
near term  I hope   Sherin said on Tuesday  GE s decision to sharpen
focus on manufacturing of big ticket items such as jet engines and
power turbines won wide favor from investors who said the company s
finance division  and the regulatory burden that came with it  was
weighing down its stock valuation  GE Capital s size and the potential
risk from its lending portfolio has made it subject to government
oversight  The company plans to apply next year to escape its
designation as a systemically important financial institution
although Sherin said the path to do so was not entirely clear   We re
the first  there s no specific process   he said   We understand why
we were designated as a systemic financial institution and if we
address those factors     we think we will be able to achieve that
goal   Some analysts have worried that rising interest rates or a drop
in the stock market could hurt valuations for GE Capital s remaining
assets  Sherin said he is not particularly concerned about a slight
rise in interest rates    A severe dislocation in financial markets of
some type would slow us down  for sure   Sherin said",2015-06-30,Reuters

Chemical Bank and the banks it merged with  taking increasingly senior
positions until 2000  when he was sidelined as head of investment
banking at what was then Chase Manhattan   Lee started instead

rivals and selling themselves  and on raising money  He played a key
role in the merger of United Airlines and Continental Airlines to form
United Continental Holdings Inc  N UAL   the takeover of Wall Street

that use the bank  a person familiar with the matter said   The banker
felt short of breath while running on a treadmill at home on Wednesday
morning  according to a person briefed on the matter who requested not
to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter   The sudden
death surprised colleagues who were working with Lee as recently as
this week    We re in total shock   said one senior JPMorgan banker
Lee s father died at the age of 47 from a heart attack  The younger
Lee was just 11 years old at the time  according to a 2000 profile in

group    Jimmy was a master of his craft  but he was so much more   he
was an incomparable force of nature   Jamie Dimon  JPMorgan s chief
executive  said in the statement  Lee was fiercely loyal to JPMorgan

billions of dollars from JPMorgan s results  Lee arranged to have New
England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady call Dimon and remind the CEO
that even Super Bowl champs have bad days  according to a 2012 story
in Vanity Fair   Private equity firm Blackstone  N BX  tried to hire
Lee away in the early part of last decade  but failed in the end
Blackstone chairman and chief executive Steve Schwarzman told
TheStreet in 2009    We were quite close at that time to a deal  But

many others did   when we were a small company with little revenue he
told us and anyone else who would listen how much potential he thought
Facebook had    Other clients agreed about Lee s drive to do deals
He was eternally optimistic that a deal could be done when he started
one   Jack Welch  former Chairman and Chief Executive of  General
Electric  Co   N GE  told Reuters   Lee was a legendary rainmaker  but
like a classic old line banker  he cared about risk on the loans he
was making  because JPMorgan would suffer when loans went bad  Enrico
Dallavecchia  a former senior risk executive at JPMorgan  recalled
meetings with Lee in the 1990s to decide whether the bank should make
big loans    He was ahead of his time in terms of understanding risk
Dallavecchia said   If he felt that the returns were not high enough

sources familiar with the matter   The European Commission opened a
full investigation in February to consider competition implications of
a deal that would remove one of GE s three rivals in the manufacturing
of heavy duty turbines for gas fired power plants  EU regulators
typically prefer merging companies to sell overlapping assets or make
it easy for rivals to enter the market  GE s gas turbine competitors
include  Siemens  AG  DE SIEGn  and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd  T
7011   The Alstom deal  which would be the biggest acquisition in GE s
history  stands to expand GE s installed base of power turbines  which
would allow GE to gain even more lucrative revenue from servicing the
equipment  GE already altered the deal to win the French government s
backing during last year s two month battle  in which it fended off
Siemens and Mitsubishi  In the interview  Bolze acknowledged the
protracted process  for Alstom  and said GE was focused on  how to
move     forward as it makes sense   In GE s first quarter conference
call last month  Chief Executive Jeff Immelt backed the deal s fit for
GE  but said if it  ever would become unattractive  we wouldn t do it
GE  which is undergoing an overhaul involving the exit of most of its
finance assets  has said it expected synergies from the Alstom deal to
add between 6 to 9 cents in earnings per share in 2016  But some
analysts have told Reuters they doubt GE s stock would take a big hit
should the deal collapse  with the idea that GE could make up those
earnings with stock buybacks or other deals  The antitrust
investigation was halted on April 24  according to a filing on the
European Commission website  GE said on Monday it expects regulators
to resume scrutiny of the deal this week and that the temporary
suspension was part of the regulatory process   This is a procedural
step to give them time to review additional information   the company
said in a statement  EC spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said regulators are
waiting for data from the companies before a setting a new deadline to
act  The previous deadline was Aug  6  Immelt met European Competition

271,German police search house of pilot who flew A320 into mountain,"By Tim Hepher and Jean Francois Rosnoblet PARIS SEYNE LES ALPES
Reuters    A young German co pilot locked himself alone in the cockpit
of Germanwings flight 9525 and set it on course to crash into an
Alpine mountain  killing all 150 people on board including himself
prosecutors said on Thursday  French prosecutors offered no motive for
why 28 year old Andreas Lubitz apparently took the controls of the
Airbus A320  locked the captain out of the cockpit and deliberately
set it veering down from cruising altitude at 3 000 feet per minute
German police were searching his home for evidence that might offer
some explanation for what was behind Tuesday s crash in the French
Alps  French and German officials said there was no indication he was
a terrorist  Acquaintances described Lubitz as an affable young man
who had given no sign of harboring harmful intent  According to
Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin  Lubitz acted  for a reason we cannot
fathom right now but which looks like intent to destroy this aircraft
Setting the plane s controls for rapid descent was an act that  could
only have been voluntary   Robin said   He had    no reason to stop
the pilot in command from coming back into the cockpit  He had no
reason to refuse to answer to the air controller who was alerting him
on the loss of altitude   The captain  who had stepped out of the
cockpit  probably to use the toilet  tried to force his way back in
You can hear banging to try to smash the door down   Robin said
Describing sound recordings from one of the plane s black boxes  Robin
said most of the passengers would not have been aware of their fate
until the very end   Only toward the end do you hear screams   he said
And bear in mind that death would have been instantaneous   the
aircraft was literally smashed to bits   FlightRadar24  an online air
tracking service that uses satellite data  said it had found evidence
the autopilot was abruptly switched from cruising height to maintain
an altitude of just 100 feet  the lowest possible setting  The plane
crashed at about 6 000 feet   Between 09 30 52 and 09 30 55 you can
see that the autopilot was manually changed from 38 000 feet to 100
feet and 9 seconds later the aircraft started to descend  probably
with the  open descent  autopilot setting   Fredrik Lindahl  chief
executive of the Swedish tracking service  said  The CEO of Lufthansa
parent company of Germanwings  said its air crew were picked carefully
and subjected to psychological vetting   No matter your safety
regulations  no matter how high you set the bar  and we have
incredibly high standards  there is no way to rule out such an event
CEO Carsten Spohr said  Attention will now focus on the motivations of
Lubitz  a German national who joined the budget carrier in September
2013 and had just 630 hours of flying time   compared with the 6 000
hours of the flight captain  named in German media only as  Patrick S
in accordance with usual practice   SUICIDE  THE WRONG WORD Robin said
there were no grounds to suspect that Lubitz was carrying out a
terrorist attack   Suicide  was also the wrong word to describe
actions which killed so many other people  the prosecutor added   I
don t necessarily call it suicide when you have responsibility for 100
or so lives   The family of the co pilot arrived in France for a
tribute alongside other victims but was being kept apart from the
others  Robin said  Police set up guard outside Lubitz s house in
Montabaur  Germany  Acquaintances in the town said they were stunned
I m just speechless  I don t have any explanation for this  Knowing
Andreas  this is just inconceivable for me   said Peter Ruecker  a
long time member of the local flight club where Lubitz received his
flying license years ago   He was a lot of fun  even though he was
perhaps sometimes a bit quiet  He was just another boy like so many
others here   A photo on Lubitz s Facebook  NASDAQ FB  page  which was
later taken down  shows a smiling young man posing in front of San
Francisco s Golden Gate bridge  Robin said the conversation between
the two pilots before the captain left the cockpit started normally
but that Lubitz s replies became  laconic  as they started readying
what would have been the normal descent to the airport of Duesseldorf
His responses become very brief  There is no proper exchange as such
he said  Investigators were still searching for the second of the two
black boxes on Thursday in the ravine where the plane crashed  100 km
65 miles  from Nice  which would contain data from the plane s
instruments  Pilots may temporarily leave the cockpit at certain times
and in certain circumstances  such as while the aircraft is cruising
according to German aviation law   Cockpit doors can be opened from
the outside with a code  in line with regulations introduced after the
Sept  11  2001 attacks in the United States  but the code can be
overridden from inside the cockpit  Lufthansa s CEO said that either
the pilot had entered the code incorrectly  or the co pilot inside had
overridden it  Germanwings said 72 Germans were killed in the first
major air passenger disaster on French soil since the 2000 Concorde
accident just outside Paris  Madrid revised down on Thursday the
number of Spanish victims to 50 from 51 previously  As well as Germans
and Spaniards  victims included three Americans  a Moroccan and
citizens of Britain  Argentina  Australia  Belgium  Colombia  Denmark
Israel  Japan  Mexico  Iran and the Netherlands  officials said
However  DNA checks to identify them could take weeks  the French
government said   The families of victims were being flown to
Marseille on Thursday before being taken up to the zone close to the
crash site  Chapels had been prepared for them with a view of the
mountain where their relatives died",2015-03-26,Reuters
272,Wall Street sanguine as it heads into worst earnings season in six years ,"By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK  Reuters    Wall Street is greeting
what is expected to be the worst earnings season since 2009 with a
gigantic shrug  Though there has been some selling in recent weeks
there s been no panic dumping of stocks  even though forecasts for S P
500 first quarter earnings have tumbled since Jan  1  thanks to the
surging dollar  falling oil prices and another severe winter  The
earnings season unofficially kicks off Wednesday with results from
aluminum company  Alcoa   N AA    Among some key early results
JPMorgan Chase  N JPM  is due to report next week along with other
banks and  General Electric   N GE   First quarter S P 500 earnings
are projected to have declined by 2 8 percent from a year ago  which
would make the quarter the worst for results since the third quarter
of 2009  not long after the United States emerged from the Great
Recession  according to Thomson Reuters data  But investor sentiment
has been boosted by optimism that the Federal Reserve will continue to
delay its first interest rate hike in nearly a decade  The S P 500
lost 1 7 percent in March but remains up 0 8 percent for the year so
far   The market is holding up remarkably well    all in the face of
earnings concerns and the fact that economic news is a little worse
than expected   said Robert Pavlik  chief market strategist at Boston
Private Wealth in New York   It speaks to people s expectations that
the Federal Reserve is going to remain on hold at least until
September  maybe a little longer   S P 500 earnings typically beat
lowered analysts  expectations  and strategists said the unusually
large drop in first quarter forecasts sets a low bar for companies to
surpass  Energy is expected to take the biggest hit this earnings
period  although analysts have cut projections for every sector  The
market is  not expecting much  from earnings this quarter  said Joe
Bell  senior equity analyst at Schaeffer s Investment Research in
Cincinnati  which means  the higher probability would be for an upside
surprise   From the first quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of
2014  the median difference between the initial earnings forecast in a
quarter and the final result is a gain of 8 5 percentage points
Thomson Reuters data showed  The drop in estimates has been well
telegraphed  especially by U S  companies themselves  If earnings do
come in along the lines predicted by analysts  stocks would look a bit
pricey  but any positive surprises could result in shares being
reasonably valued  The S P 500 s forward price to earnings ratio
stands at 16 7  down from more than 17 in recent weeks but roughly
where it was at the end of 2014  The historical average is 14 9
Thomson Reuters data showed  Outlooks from S P 500 companies are the
most negative since the fourth quarter of 2013  according to Thomson
Reuters data  Of the 128 outlooks from S P 500 companies  105 were
negative and 17 were positive  Among those 105 warnings on the quarter
at least 69 companies cited the stronger dollar as a headwind  making
it the most common complaint  according to a Thomson Reuters analysis
A stronger dollar tends to dampen profits for U S  multinationals when
overseas profits are translated back into dollars  The dollar gained 9
percent against a basket of currencies  DXY  in the first quarter
Priceline  O PCLN  and Hewlett Packard  N HPQ  were among companies
with the most pronounced currency impact  the search showed   Our
biggest short term challenge is currency   Priceline s president and
chief executive  Darren Huston  said in the company s Feb  19
conference call  noting that more than 90 percent of Priceline s
business is in its international brands  Just a handful of companies
pointed to this winter s weather  which brought heavy snowfall in
parts of the country  At least 11 companies cited lower oil prices as
a negative  while 13 cited energy as a positive factor  No S P 500
energy companies gave quarterly guidance  which is often the case  but
big predicted declines in energy shares is the largest reason for the
overall negative outlook   S P 500 energy earnings are projected to
have dropped 64 percent from a year ago  Thomson Reuters data showed
U S  oil prices are down about 50 percent since the end of June
Without energy  S P 500 earnings for the quarter are forecast to have
risen 5 4 percent",2015-04-08,Reuters

Bombardier  TO BBDb  is exploring ways to raise money from its
transportation unit  which bankers value at up to  5 billion  as the
Canadian group grapples with huge cost overruns in its aircraft
business  six sources familiar with the matter said  The world s
largest manufacturer of planes and trains is working with banks on the
strategic options for its transport arm  which provides rail vehicles
signaling and control equipment  the sources said on Friday  Among the
options are a possible sale of all or part of the business  as well as
an initial public offering  IPO  either in Germany  where the business
in based  or in the UK  three sources said  declining to be named
since the matter is private   A merger with peers such as Germany s
Siemens   DE SIEGn  or France s  Alstom   PA ALSO  could also be
considered  one of the sources said  referring to a tie up between
China s biggest train makers CNR and CSR Corp  HK 1766   SS 601766
last year which put pressure on rivals to gain scale  Discussions are
in early stages and Bombardier may delay any action until potential
buyers like Alstom and Hitachi  T 6501  have finished wrapping up
recent transactions  the sources said  The discussions come as
Bombardier s aircraft business battles with overruns in cost and
development for its new CSeries jet  which has sent the firm s stock
down 38 percent this year   In February the company suspended
dividends  replaced its chief executive  took on new long term debt
and said it would issue new shares to shore up its finances
Bombardier has more than  9 billion of long term debt  according to
documents from its most recent bond deal  Its market capitalization is
currently C 5 89 billion   4 66 billion   giving an enterprise value
of about  13 7 billion  Bombardier spokeswoman Isabelle Rondeau noted
that the company has previously said it is interested in
participating in consolidation   She added that many options were on
the table  but there was no fire sale    We re in no rush to do
anything   she said   We will act in a diligent and smart way to make
sure that whatever we do will create value for our shareholders
Bombardier shares jumped as much as 7 3 percent to C 2 79 in early
Toronto trading on the back of the Reuters report  At 1120 ET they
were up 4 2 percent   POTENTIAL BUYERS BUSY  The transportation arm
saw earnings before interest and tax  EBIT  of  486 million in 2014
down 3 7 percent from 2013  The unit could appeal to sector rivals
like Siemens  Alstom  Hitachi or GE  the sources said  Siemens and
Alstom might however face antitrust issues because of their dominant
positions in Germany and France  said the sources  Alstom is also
currently busy with its 12 4 billion euro sale of its power equipment
business to  General Electric   N GE   and is unlikely to embark on a
new deal before that is completed  said the sources  Japan s Hitachi
is also tied up after agreeing in February to acquire the rail
business of Italian group  Finmeccanica   MI SIFI  for 1 9 billion
euros  China s CNR and CSR Corp are not expected to seek further
expansion in the near future    Banking sources expect consolidation
to continue as the sector remains fragmented",2015-04-10,Reuters
274,Egypt s Sawiris to diversify Orascom  invest  500 million in Egypt,"By Stephen Kalin and Michael Georgy SHARM EL SHEIKH  Egypt  Reuters
Top Egyptian businessman Naguib Sawiris said he was ready to invest
500 million in Egypt and was diversifying his telecoms business into
infrastructure  energy and transportation  sectors which need major
funds in the country  Sawiris  a billionaire from a powerful Coptic
Christian family  said the investment conference in the Red Sea resort
of Sharm El Sheikh had been a success but that the government would
need to make efforts to follow up with investors   We all know the
minute the decisions go down to our famous and most regarded
bureaucrats you see one sign only  stop  They need to have a pusher
and the minister of investment is a pusher   said Sawiris  60
chairman and chief executive of Orascom Telecom  Media and Technology
CA OTMT   He said the government should form a committee to firmly
thrust the investment agenda forward and help revive Egypt s economy
laid low by four years of political turmoil triggered by the 2011
revolt which toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak   My advice    is the
prime minister should initiate a small office headed by the investment
minister with some drivers who continue the dialogue with the
investors who committed to the projects in this conference   said
Sawiris  Egypt clinched investments worth billions of dollars from top
global companies such as  General Electric   N GE    BP   L BP  and
Eni  MI ENI  at the conference  which ends on Sunday  Gulf Arab allies
also pledged  12 5 billion  Sawiris said Orascom Telecom would
diversify into new sectors including infrastructure  logistics and
energy projects alongside its core business   I am going to be
extremely aggressive here in my investments  We have firepower right
now of 500 million dollars  Today we signed  100 million out of this
500   Sawiris told Reuters in an interview at the investment
conference   We are the first and the only Egyptian company till now
to sign the solar power energy 50 megawatts today   Sawiris said he
also saw opportunities in Tunisia   We are willing to duplicate our
investments in Egypt in Tunisia  because it s stable  because the
political Islamists are more wise than ours here   he said  CRITICIZES
ISLAMISTS  QUESTIONS ARMY ROLE IN ECONOMY Sawiris was a vocal opponent
of the Muslim Brotherhood  the Islamist movement removed from power by
then army chief Abdel Fattah al Sisi  who went on to become president
Sawiris said he opposed reconciliation with the Brotherhood and  like
the government  accuses it of carrying out bombings that have killed
hundreds of people since the army toppled Islamist President Mohamed
Mursi following mass protests in mid 2013  He called on them to
unilaterally renounce violence   Then they will find liberal people
like us defending their rights  their rights of existence  their
rights of being a political party   he said  But Sawiris said he could
not forgive acts of violence   I remember Jesus when he was on the
cross and he said   please forgive them   Ok  but he s Jesus  I cannot
do that   said Sawiris  He became emotional when recalling watching a
video showing of Islamic State militants beheading 21 fellow Egyptian
Coptic Christians in Libya last month   You want to tell me I should
give the other cheek to these people  I ll go out and find them  That
s my dream  to go out and find these people   he said   I come from
the south  In the south  if you kill one of my family  I kill ten of
your family    It s based on revenge   Sawiris said Egyptians had set
aside concerns over human rights  which he described as  not ideal
to focus on the economy  but stressed Egyptians should not abandon
hopes generated by the 2011 uprising   We will concede to the will of
the people that we need to build the country first  but once the
country stands on its feet  we will not accept less than a true  total
liberal  democratic  society    said Sawiris  founder of the liberal
Free Egyptians Party  Turning to one of the most sensitive issues in
Egypt  Sawiris was adamant that the military should not have a role in
the economy  The armed forces said to control up to 40 percent of the
economy  Sisi told Reuters last year it was more like 2 percent   It
distracts the main focus because we are under a lot of threats  They
will not like what I say now but that s my opinion   said Sawiris   An
army should focus one and only task and that is defending Egypt  Where
else in the world do other armies have businesses",2015-03-15,Reuters

Airbus operated by Lufthansa s Germanwings budget airline crashed into
a mountainside in the French Alps on Tuesday  killing all 150 people
on board including 16 schoolchildren  Germanwings confirmed its flight
4U 9525 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf went down with 144 passengers
and six crew on board  One of the plane s black box recorders has been
found at the crash site  about 100 km  65 miles  north of the Riviera
city of Nice  and will be examined immediately  France s interior
minister said  In Washington  the White House said the crash did not
appear to have been caused by a terrorist attack  while Lufthansa said
it was working on the assumption that the tragedy had been an accident
adding that any other theory would be speculation  Aerial photographs
showed smoldering wreckage and a piece of the fuselage with six
windows strewn across the steep mountainside cut by ravines    We saw
an aircraft that had literally been ripped apart  the bodies are in a
state of destruction  there is not one intact piece of wing or
fuselage   Brice Robin  prosecutor for the city of Marseille  told
Reuters after flying over the wreckage in a helicopter  Germanwings
believed 67 Germans had been on the flight  Spain s deputy prime
minister said 45 passengers had Spanish names  One Belgian was also
aboard  Also among the victims were 16 children and two teachers from
the Joseph Koenig Gymnasium high school in the town of Haltern am See
in northwest Germany  a spokeswoman said  French police at the crash
site about 2 000 meters  6 000 feet  above sea level said no one
survived and it would take days to recover the bodies due to difficult
terrain  snow and incoming storms  Police said search teams would stay
overnight at altitude   We are still searching  It s unlikely any
bodies will be airlifted until Wednesday   regional police chief David
Galtier told Reuters  In Paris  Prime Minister Manuel Valls told
parliament   A helicopter managed to land  by the crash site  and has
confirmed that unfortunately there were no survivors   It was the
first crash of a large passenger jet on French soil since the Concorde
disaster just outside Paris nearly 15 years ago  The A320 is a
workhorse of aviation fleets and one of the world s most used
passenger jets  It has a good safety record  However  according to
data from the Aviation Safety Network  Tuesday s crash was the third
most deadly involving an A320  In 2007 a TAM Linhas Aereas A320 shot
off a runway in Brazil  killing 187 people  while 162 people died when
an Indonesia AirAsia jet went down in the Java Sea in December  SHARP

that while the Airbus had descended rapidly  its rate of descent did
not suggest it had simply fallen out of the sky  France s DGAC
aviation authority said air traffic controllers initiated distress
procedures after they lost contact with the Airbus   The aircraft did
not itself make a distress call but it was the combination of the loss
of radio contact and the aircraft s descent which led the controller
to implement the distress phase   a DGAC spokesman said   In

first priority  then pay attention to navigation and only then
communicate with the ground  The aircraft came down in an alpine

276,Strong dollar vexes mid sized U S  exporters  local demand helps,"By Nick Carey CHICAGO  Reuters    First thing every morning Bill
Hickey turns on the TV to see where the U S  dollar is trading in the
hope it has lost value against the euro and other currencies   And
there it is  staring you right in the face   says Hickey  president of
Chicago based steel company Lapham Hickey Steel  about the dollar s
continued strength   The strong dollar is going to be bad for us and
it s going to be bad for the U S  industrial economy   Mid sized U S
manufacturers  such as Lapham Hickey  are likely to bear the brunt of
the dollar s climb that has lifted it nearly 10 percent against the
euro and 7 percent against major currencies since mid December
Foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters shortly after the euro
hit an 11 year low of  1 11 on Jan 26 cited a nearly one in three
chance the euro would hit parity or lower in the coming year
Multinational giants with operations around the world are less
vulnerable because they have costs in local currencies that act as de
facto currency hedges  But small and medium sized U S  firms  which
account for about a third of U S  exports  worry that the strong
dollar will make their goods more expensive in foreign markets and
less competitive at home  While most major currencies  including the
yen and the pound  have been weakening against the dollar over the
past months  the euro tumbled the most in recent weeks  a boon for
manufacturers in Germany and beyond  Hickey has not yet laid off any
of the 600 workers at the company s six plants  five around the
Midwest and one in Connecticut  and is seeking new customers to offset
lost business  But he worries about the dollar s impact on key clients
such as Caterpillar Inc  Deere   Co or major automakers  Caterpillar
CEO Doug Oberhelman voiced his concern in a Jan  27 call with analysts
saying Japanese  UK or German rivals had  quite an advantage over
their American competitors   Some say the real pain has yet to come
given that particularly the euro s sharp losses have been a relatively
recent phenomenon  Others point out that tumbling oil and commodity
prices have made it harder to discern the currency effect  Indiana
Manufacturers Association president Patrick Kiely said the dollar was
just one agenda item at a recent board meeting   There are so many
moving parts  it s really too early to tell   Drew Greenblatt
president of Baltimore based Marlin Steel  which makes custom metal
forms from baskets to hooks  says weak eurozone demand so far is a
bigger concern for his business than the strong dollar   We re not
hearing from customers  your products are too expensive    Greenblatt
said   We re hearing  the project has been canceled because the
economy is in the tank   Still  he expects a strengthening U S
economy to more than make up for stagnant European sales  predicting
Marlin Steel s revenue will grow to  7 million this year from  5 5
million  Over the next 18 months  Greenblatt plans to spend  2 million
on new robots  expand his factory floor and add 10 new employees to
his 30 strong work force  Bill Dunkelberg  chief economist at the
National Federation of Independent Business  NFIB   sees similar
pattern among many other small and medium sized businesses   The fact
that the U S  economy is bopping along really does help   he said  The
latest evidence of its improving health came on Friday  with non farm
payrolls shooting up by 257 000 last month  beating economists
forecasts  The flip side is that European rivals are also taking note
In a survey released by the German American Chambers of Commerce in
December  just as the euro was starting its swoon against the dollar
98 percent of German firms polled said they expected to grow their
business in the United States in 2015  The survey focused on German
Mittelstand  or small and medium sized firms which generally do not
have U S factories   To these firms  2015 looks like a very rosy year
said Mark Tomkins  vice president of the German American Chamber of
Commerce in the Midwest   We see tremendous potential in the U S
market   says Andy Stecher who runs the North American operations of
German firm Plasmatreat  For the company  which makes machines that
apply plasma technology for everything from airplane wings to car
headlights  the growing U S  economy is more important than currency
fluctuations  Stecher says  But the strong dollar comes as an added
benefit and Plasmatreat expects to boost its U S  sales  The NFIB s
Dunkelberg said customers of U S  based manufacturers were unlikely
too switch suppliers if the dollar s strength proved short lived  but
the longer it lasts  the greater the impact    If it becomes clear
that we re expensive and we re going to stay there for a while
customers will adjust and then we ll feel it   he said",2015-02-09,Reuters
277,General Electric to allow shareholders to nominate directors,"By Sarah N  Lynch WASHINGTON  Reuters    General Electric Co  N GE
will allow shareholders to nominate their own corporate directors
becoming one of the few companies to adopt proxy access reforms in a
move that could pave the way for others  The company said the new
bylaws  which went into effect Feb  6  will allow a single shareholder
or a group of up to 20 shareholders who own more than 3 percent of the
company s stock for at least three years to nominate up to 20 percent
of the board s directors  GE s move  disclosed in a filing with the U
S  Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday  comes at a time
when regulators at the SEC are starting to more closely scrutinize
proxy reforms in general   GE just taught corporate America a lesson
in what a responsive board looks like   said New York City Comptroller
Scott M  Stringer  who oversees the city s pension funds and has filed
dozens of shareholder proposals at other companies to permit proxy
access   Voluntarily implementing proxy access is a sign that the push
for a significant voice in the boardroom is breaking through   he
added  Several years ago  the SEC under then chair Mary Schapiro
adopted rules requiring public companies to let shareholders nominate
directors to corporate boards if certain thresholds were met  Schapiro
is now on the board of GE  The U S  Chamber of Commerce and the
Business Roundtable  which represent companies  interests on Capitol
Hill  successfully challenged the rules in court  citing concerns that
such rules could advance the agendas of activist investors  who buy
stakes in companies and lobby for management and other changes  In an
emailed statement  GE said it has  always emphasized shareowner
accountability  and proxy access is another tool to provide that
accountability   Currently  shareholders must file resolutions on a
company by company basis requesting changes in the bylaws to create a
process for them to nominate directors  unless companies like GE
decide to make the change voluntarily   Next week  the SEC is slated
to hold a roundtable to explore ways to improve the proxy voting
process  Last month  the agency caused a bit of a stir in the
corporate world when it abruptly announced it would not weigh in on a
dispute between Whole Foods  O WFM  and shareholder James McRitchie
over two competing proposals that would let shareholders nominate
directors   Under SEC rules  companies can exclude shareholder
proposals if they are deemed too similar to the ones put forth by
management  The SEC is now re evaluating this rule  The U S  Chamber
of Commerce estimates that only a handful of companies have adopted
proxy access  Many companies have actively sought to beat back such
efforts   GE is a longtime leader in corporate governance  and the
fact that their board has taken this step will raise interest in
dealing with this issue proactively at other boards   said John Olson
an attorney for Gibson  Dunn   Crutcher   According to Thomson Reuters
data  the shareholders who own more than three percent of GE shares
are the Vanguard Group  State Street Global Advisors  N STT   and the
BlackRock Institutional Trust  N BLK   Tom Quaadman  a vice president
at the Chamber s Center for Capital Market Competitiveness  said GE s
actions reflect the proper approach companies should take when
weighing this issue    It should be up to companies and shareholders
to decide   he said",2015-02-11,Reuters
278,Sweden s Wallenberg dynasty prepares for sixth generation,"By Alistair Scrutton and Niklas Pollard STOCKHOLM  Reuters    Jacob
Wallenberg  the 58 year old head of one of Europe s most enduring
family dynasties  is trying to work out how the empire controlling
much of Sweden s economy could look with a woman or someone without
the family name at the helm  Roughly 30 members of the sixth
generation  aged between 15 and 30  are contenders to see if they
could one day run Wallenberg s Investor holding company and several
foundations with major stakes in Electrolux  Atlas Copco and Ericsson
There are no clear favorites and the job could also go to an outsider
but whoever is picked to lead an empire so famous a popular beef dish
takes the family name  will have to decide if it should invest in new
and faster growth companies beyond its financial and industrial roots
In egalitarian Sweden  the family is seen as a model of how to expand
a company through generations without squabbles and the appointment
will be made according to experience rather than assertions of
birthright  Wallenberg  who has not indicated he plans to step down
organizes seminars for some young family members at an old estate
They have to get the experience  and then we ll see what happens  And
the sixth generation is in the middle of that right now   said Jacob
Wallenberg  sitting in his wood paneled office five minutes walk from
Stockholm s Royal Palace  The empire began in 1856 when Andre Oscar
Wallenberg founded Stockholms Enskilda Bank  now part of SEB  The
family s fame and influence grew with the company  helped by the
construction of a wealthy Stockholm suburb and one scion who became a
hero for saving Jews in Hungary in World War II  While many family
empires implode in feuds or have the assets split by an ever growing
number of descendents  the Wallenbergs have so far avoided this  They
began channeling their wealth into non profit foundations in 1917
which control over 50 percent of voting rights in Investor and other
assets in an empire that is today largely run by Jacob and his cousin
Marcus   The Wallenbergs separated the money from the power   said
Gunnar Wetterberg  author of  Wallenberg   A family empire    The
harmony that appears to exist today between the cousins is not at all
a foregone conclusion   The Wallenbergs are wealthy but not among the
top 100 richest Swedes listed by magazine Veckans Affarer  Jacob
Wallenberg earned some  320 000 last year in salaries from his
chairmanship of Investor  according to the firm s annual report   It
sort of boils down to that we are not personally owners of this  We
cannot run into the squabble part   Wallenberg said   I have to go to
a job and earn my living  like everyone else   He gradually took over
from his grandfather  He had worked at SEB after spending several
years in the navy and getting an MBA in the United States  History has
made the family wary of the pressures of the job  Jacob s uncle  Marc
Wallenberg  slated to assume the helm of the empire  committed suicide
in 1971  shocking Sweden  His daughter  Caroline Ankarcrona  made
headlines when she became the first female family member to sit on the
board of the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and Jacob Wallenberg
said he would like to see more women coming through  NEW STRATEGY
Under Jacob and Marcus Wallenberg as well as CEO Borje Ekholm   a
family outsider   Investor has moved into unlisted companies from
medical services to schools  Unlisted firms have jumped to nearly a
quarter of Investor s holdings  Still with most holdings in a comfort
zone of listed blue chips  some investors would like a more aggressive
strategy  It is something the Wallenberg s largely fend off  with a
priority on long term planning rather than quarterly deadlines  Others
say Investor has moved too slowly  It entered healthcare and champions
R D spending  but it shunned high growth consumer technology  in
contrast to family run Kinnevik   I think he  Jacob  is a bit risk
averse   said an executive who has worked with Wallenberg for more
than a decade  Some point to rival Swedish holding company Kinnevik
and its bold bets on fast growing online ventures such as Zalando  but
for all that Investor shares are up 129 percent over the past three
years versus an 82 percent gain in Kinnevik   Over time I wouldn t be
surprised if you saw one or two more unlisted companies   said
Wallenberg   But is it something where you see quick moves
significant moves  No   We re working on buying to hold rather than
buying to sell   Business relationships fostered over more than a
century often give even existing holdings an edge when deals are
struck in sectors familiar to the Wallenbergs  such as in Electrolux
3 3 billion buy of General Electric s appliances business   I think
when it comes to the long term relationship between GE and Electrolux
it went through the Wallenbergs   said Electrolux chairman Ronnie
Leten    When it comes to the CEOs of these big international
companies  the Wallenbergs know these people    Additional reporting

279,Siemens sees consolidation  not growth  in 2015,"By Georgina Prodhan and Jens Hack  BERLIN  Reuters    German
engineering group Siemens  DE SIEGn  resigned itself to another year
of flat sales on Thursday after reporting that one off charges hit
profits again in the fourth quarter  this time for wind turbines
Siemens  one of Germany s biggest companies and a major exporter of
goods from trains to hospital equipment  said it first aimed to
improve the operating margin for its core industrial businesses to
close a gap with rivals before focusing on growth again   Chief
Executive Joe Kaeser  who took over in a boardroom coup a year ago  is
on a mission to simplify the once sprawling conglomerate  weeding out
or fixing underperforming businesses and allowing the stronger ones to
shine   Kaeser has already sold a hospital IT unit and Siemens  stake
in home appliances joint venture SBH  and bought oilfield equipment
company Dresser Rand to help its ailing energy unit catch up on
exploiting the U S  shale boom   He said he was now determined to get
on top of operational problems that keep cropping up in Siemens
businesses  most recently in wind turbines where problems with blades
and bearings caused a 223 million euro   279 million  charge in the
fourth quarter    2015 will be the year of operational consolidation
We still have a few challenges to overcome and to make better on the
way we execute our orders into revenues  We ve had a few setbacks
Kaeser told Reuters Television    We ve got a lot on our plate but we
know where we re going   he said    Chief Financial Officer Ralf
Thomas said the Munich based group wanted to bring annual one off
charges for such issues  which amounted to 900 million euros for the
year to end September  down to an average of 350 million euros
Siemens is also now aiming for an industrial profit margin of 10 to 11
percent in the current fiscal year  introducing a new measure to help
it benchmark itself better against rivals   The margin figure  which
Kaeser said would be a clear improvement on last year s  compares with
Swiss ABB s  VX ABBN  14 3 percent third quarter operating margin  and
a 16 3 percent industrial margin at arch rival General Electric  N GE
Siemens shares were up 0 5 percent at 89 53 euros by 1100 GMT  7 a m
EST   after the company said it would raise its dividend by 10 percent
to 3 30 euros per share    The outlook looks muted and our estimates
might prove to be too optimistic  However  we expect that also in FY
2014 15 portfolio adjustments remain the key share price driver   DZ
Bank analyst Jasko Terzic said in a note   HEARING AIDS SALE  Siemens
also announced on Thursday it has agreed to sell its hearing aid unit
Siemens Audiology Solutions  to private equity firm EQT  EQT UL  and
Germany s Struengmann family for 2 15 billion euros   In addition it
said the legal separation of its healthcare unit in countries
including Germany  a possible precursor to an eventual full or part
disposal that could raise the value of the unit and the rest of the
company    We can react as the market demands at any time   Kaeser
told Reuters Television   ENERGY CHALLENGES  Siemens reported a 28
percent rise in its fourth quarter operating profit  which it calls
total sectors profit   to 2 2 billion euros   2 76 billion   short of
the average estimate of 2 25 billion euros given in a Reuters poll of
analysts  Sales were unchanged at 20 6 billion euros   Fourth quarter
orders rose 2 percent to 20 7 billion euros  beating expectations  but
like for like order intake from emerging markets fell 14 percent from
a high base last year   Profits at the Energy Sector unit tumbled 28

euros    Challenges are growing in the power generation business
said Lisa Davis  the new head of the Energy Sector unit  recently

or projects   The 48 countries of sub Saharan Africa  with a combined
population of 800 million  produce roughly the same amount of power as
Spain  a country of just 46 million   The shortage imposes a massive
burden on economies in the continent  constraining growth and leading
to hundreds of millions of people remaining mired in poverty   U S

Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  APEC  summit and is expected to
meet China s President Xi Jinping for dinner on Tuesday night and
again for more formal talks on Wednesday    We are working on a whole

month selloff in shares of large U S  manufacturers will be looking
for solid revenue growth and order trends in third quarter earnings
reports starting on Friday to help allay fears that a soft global
economy will derail the outlook for diverse industrial names
Concerns over weak economic growth in Europe and stagnation in
emerging markets have dented shares of these large industrial
companies  which depend on sales outside of the United States
according to portfolio managers and analysts who follow the stocks
As far as the diversified industrials  the big bugaboo the last month
is if you have a higher concentration of sales in China and Europe
said Charlie Smith  chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital
Stocks of diverse manufacturers have underperformed the broader U S
market this year  to the point that Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe
said on Monday they were in  official correction territory   The
stronger dollar reduces the value of foreign sales  while worry over
slowdowns in some industrial markets such as energy also could be
dampening expectations    It s time for companies to prove they re
worth paying up for  and hopefully we ll see that in demand   said
John Heslin  who follows industrial companies as vice president at
Tradition Capital Management   Third quarter reports for large diverse
manufacturers kick off on Friday with General Electric  N GE  and
Honeywell International  N HON   At an investor meeting last week  GE
Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt  whose company is often viewed as
an economic bellwether  said GE was seeing healthy orders despite
global volatility    I still think we re kind of in the same world
recovering from the financial crisis that s got slow growth and
volatility   Immelt said   Barclays analyst Scott Davis forecast 4
percent quarterly core sales growth for diverse manufacturers  saying
in a research note that 3 percent  would be a concern    Although
companies such as GE and United Technologies  N UTX  are not due to
forecast 2015 results until later in the year  investors certainly
will look for clues   Sales and earnings were likely to be  notably
lower  next year compared to 2014  William Blair analyst Nick Heymann
warned in a research note this week  He expects organic revenue growth
of 1 percent to 3 percent on average in 2015  versus 3 percent to 5
percent this year    The question a lot of people have is where is  15

Group  who follows industrial companies   You tend to see industrials
rally in November and December as investors look toward the growth for
next year    While the stocks at the start of the year may have looked
expensive after a big run in 2013   the valuations have pulled back

282,U S  consumer sentiment rises despite Ebola fears,"By Jason Lange WASHINGTON  Reuters    While the appearance of the
deadly Ebola virus in Texas is worrying the nation  it has yet to lead
Americans to take a more cautious view over how to spend their money
data suggested on Friday  The Thomson Reuters University of Michigan
index of consumer sentiment unexpectedly rose in early October to its
highest level since July 2007  Separate data showed groundbreaking for
new homes rose more than expected last month  and taken together the
reports pointed to solid U S  economic growth   The underlying
strength of the U S  economy remains intact   said David Berson  an
economist at Nationwide Mutual Insurance in Columbus  Ohio   If it
were not for Ebola and geopolitical concerns  these  sentiment
numbers would be higher   The data for the sentiment survey was
collected between Sept  25 and Oct  15  a period in which Americans
have been barraged by news of Ebola s spread in West Africa  where it
has killed thousands  and its appearance in the United States  U S
officials have confirmed three Ebola cases  all in Dallas  since Sept
30   a Liberian man who later died of the disease and two nurses who
had cared for him and are now being treated  Investors have been
concerned that Ebola  if not contained in the United States  could
scare consumers and lead them to cut back on spending  though there is
little sign of that so far  The consumer sentiment survey period also
overlapped with the global stock market sell off earlier this week
Economists polled by Reuters had expected the sentiment index to fall
but instead it ticked two tenths of a point higher to 86 4  Consumers
were more upbeat about their personal finances and the national
economy  Other measures of consumer confidence have also failed to
show much alarm  Gallup s daily poll of economic sentiment has been
stable in recent weeks  At least when it comes to spending decisions
consumers remain focused on a strengthening economy   Despite rising
media coverage  Ebola seems to have had little discernible effect on
consumer sentiment to date   Goldman Sachs analyst Kris Dawsey said
The U S  unemployment rate fell to 5 9 percent last month  a six year
low  Investors think the stronger job market will lead the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates next year after holding them near zero
since 2008  though worries about the global economy and chronically
low inflation have recently led them to bet the hike would be delayed
until late in the year  HOUSING RECOVERY INTACT A stronger job market
helped the housing market recovery to advance last month  with
groundbreaking at building sites rising more than expected  Housing
starts rose 6 3 percent to an annual 1 02 million unit pace  the
Commerce Department said  the latest sign the sector was continuing to
claw back after the implosion that touched off the 2007 2009 financial
crisis and recession  Newly issued permits also rose   If you look at
the trend  you are still seeing an upward trajectory   said Michelle
Meyers  an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York   U
S  stock prices jumped following a batch of solid corporate earnings

slightly higher than expected quarterly profit on Friday  with cost
cuts that helped boost margins across its industrial businesses
offsetting revenue that missed analysts  targets   Shares of GE rose 3
1 percent to  25 01 as the U S  conglomerate posted a 22 percent jump
in orders for jet engines  locomotives and other industrial equipment
and services   GE reported a 4 percent rise in organic revenue  which
excludes acquisitions  at its industrial manufacturing businesses
where Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt is increasingly focusing the
company   Although that quarterly growth missed some analysts
expectations  GE said such revenue was on track for the higher end of
its projected 2014 range of 4 percent to 7 percent growth   Reaching
that high end  would be quite a pickup   said Tim Ghriskey  chief
investment officer at Solaris Asset Management  which owns GE shares
They were able to engineer the earnings in industrials   Ghriskey said
It s just that the revenues were relatively weak    The stock is
reflecting more forward looking statements    Like those of other
diverse U S  manufacturers  GE s shares have underperformed the broad
market this year amid concerns about a soft global economy   Asked on
an analysts  call about the global economy  Immelt said   The
underlying activity is still reasonably healthy  but not universal
He added that  the U S  is probably the best we ve seen it since the
financial crisis    Immelt wants to boost GE s earnings contribution
from industrials businesses to 75 percent by 2016 from 55 percent last
year  while reducing exposure to its financing unit   GE s third
quarter net income rose 10 8 percent to  3 54 billion  or 35 cents per
share   Excluding pension costs and other items  earnings of 38 cents
per share topped analysts  average estimate by 1 cent  according to
Thomson Reuters I B E S   Revenue rose 1 percent to  36 17 billion
below the  36 79 billion analysts expected   Sales fell 2 percent in
the power and water segment  which sells energy producing turbines and
is GE s biggest industrial division  But GE projected fourth quarter
sales growth of at least 10 percent in the division  The fourth
quarter overall looks  very strong   Chief Financial Officer Jeff
Bornstein told analysts   The outlook for GE s unit selling oil and

284,FSOC may tweak process for spotting super risky firms,"By Douwe Miedema  WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  top financial risk
council may tweak the way in which it identifies insurers and other
companies that are not banks as systemically important  a process the
industry and politicians have fiercely criticized   The Financial
Stability Oversight Council  a group of the nation s main financial
regulators  has named three such companies as being so important that
their demise could pose risks to the global system  subjecting them to
tougher oversight    The council has received a number of suggestions
regarding its process for evaluating non bank financial companies for
potential designation   Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said at a meeting
of the FSOC  which he chairs   The council will begin to examine
possible changes in the coming months    Lew said that the council had
received suggestions on how to improve its process around the
designations and that he had asked staff to continue to talk to the
industry and then report back to him to see if changes were needed
Insurer MetLife Inc  N MET  on Friday said it would fight a plan by
the FSOC to designate it as a so called Systemically Important
Financial Institution  SIFI   which would make it the fourth non bank
firm overseen by the Federal Reserve   The 2010 Dodd Frank Wall Street
reform act defined banks with more than  50 billion in assets as
systemic  but left it to FSOC to determine whether some non banks also
deserved the tag   The FSOC has so far designated insurers American
International Group Inc  N AIG  and Prudential Financial Inc  N PRU
as SIFIs  along with GE Capital  the financial services arm of General
Electric Co  N GE    The designations are part of an effort to rein in
the largest and most risky companies after the collapse of investment
bank Lehman Brothers during the credit crisis showed how trouble at
just one company could roil global markets   The  182 billion bailout
of AIG after it had racked up huge losses from risky financial bets
showed that not just banks can bring the financial system to the brink
FSOC will now hold a hearing where MetLife can make its case and must
then make a final decision within 60 days  which the insurer could
challenge in court   Separately on Monday  minutes released from an
FSOC closed door vote on Metlife showed that the two members who are
insurance experts have concerns  Roy Woodall  an independent voting
member  declined to cast a yes or no vote  Another insurance regulator
who does not have a vote  also  expressed several areas of concern
about the designation   Patrick Pinschmidt  the FSOC s deputy
assistant secretary  said last month the council wanted to consider
additional reforms  speaking at a congressional hearing after the
Government Accountability Office faulted the council for a lack of
transparency and other flaws   Both Democratic and Republican
lawmakers have urged the FSOC to be less secretive and involve the
industry more into its decisions to name insurers as systemically
important    Critics are also upset because regulators have not yet
written rules that spell out what new regulations will apply to
designated companies  leaving them in limbo     Reporting by Douwe

285,Light bulb moment  Low energy LED wins Nobel prize,"By Niklas Pollard and Ben Hirschler  STOCKHOLM LONDON  Reuters    An
American and two Japanese scientists won the 2014 Nobel Prize for
Physics on Tuesday for inventing a new energy efficient and
environment friendly light source  leading to the creation of modern
LED light bulbs   Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano of Japan and
Japanese born U S  citizen Shuji Nakamura won the prize for developing
the blue light emitting diode  LED     the missing piece that now
allows manufacturers to produce white light lamps   The arrival of
such lamps is changing the way homes and workplaces are lit  offering
a longer lasting and more efficient alternative to the incandescent
bulbs pioneered by Joseph Swan and Thomas Edison at the end of the
19th century    Red and green LEDs have been around for a long time
but blue was really missing  Thanks to the blue LED we now can get
white light sources which have very high energy efficiency and very
long lifetime   Per Delsing  a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences  told a news conference   The award is a notable example of a
practical discovery winning the prize  in contrast to last year when
the physics prize went to scientists who predicted the existence of
the Higgs boson particle that explains how elementary matter attained
the mass to form stars and planets    Incandescent light bulbs lit the
20th century  the 21st century will be lit by LED lamps   the academy
said in a statement awarding the 8 million Swedish crown   1 1 million
prize   Frances Saunders  president of Britain s Institute of Physics
said the shift offered the potential for huge energy savings    With
20 percent of the world s electricity used for lighting  it s been
calculated that optimal use of LED lighting could reduce this to 4
percent  Akasaki  Amano and Nakamura s research has made this possible
and this prize recognizes this contribution   she said   Akasaki is at
the Meijo University in Japan and Amano is professor at the Nagoya
University  Nakamura is at the University of California  Santa Barbara
Contacted by telephone in the middle of the night  Nakamura said of
the award   It s unbelievable   In a later statement  he added   It is
very satisfying to see that my dream of LED lighting has become a
reality    Nakamura invented the blue light emitting diode while
working at Nichia  an unlisted firm  but received next to nothing from
the company for the work until 2004  when a Tokyo court ordered Nichia
to pay him a record 20 billion yen   185 million   The company
appealed and Nakamura settled for about  8 million   CRACKING THE
PROBLEM  Colin Humphreys  an expert at the University of Cambridge who
is working on next generation LED lighting  said the ability of the
three scientists to crack the problem of blue light when others had
failed was a tremendous achievement    Their invention of efficient
blue LEDs has paved the way for the development of bright  cost
effective and  importantly  energy efficient white lighting   he said
In addition to lighting buildings  LED bulbs are transforming lamps in
cars and the technology is also used as a light source in smartphones
and computer screens   The LED boom is upending the traditional
lighting industry and General Electric  one of the biggest players
forecasts that LEDs will account for about 70 percent of a  100
billion market by 2020  compared with 18 percent in 2012   LED lamps
last 10 times longer than fluorescent bulbs and 100 times longer than
traditional incandescent tungsten filament bulbs    The scramble to
develop more advanced and affordable versions creates both
opportunities and challenges for companies  helping to drive a shake
up in the industry    Osram was listed by its former parent Siemens
last year and Philips  after making light bulbs for 123 years  also
now plans to split off its lighting division   As winners of the
physics award  the three new laureates join some of the biggest names
in science such as Albert Einstein  Niels Bohr and the husband and
wife team of Pierre and Marie Curie   The prize is also something of a
boost to Japan s scientific reputation after it was tarnished by a
discredited high profile stem cell study that had seemed to offer hope
for replacing damaged cells or even growing new human organs   It came
on the same day as the author of that study  Haruko Obokata  was told
by Waseda University that it will strip her of her doctorate unless
she corrects it within a year   Obokata s discovery was first
trumpeted as a game changer  but questions soon arose about the
research and investigations found that Obokata had plagiarized and
fabricated parts of the papers    Physics was the second of this year
s crop of Nobels  The prizes were first awarded in 1901 to honor
achievements in science  literature and peace in accordance with the
will of dynamite inventor and business tycoon Alfred Nobel

Reuters    Industrial conglomerate Siemens AG  DE SIEGn  is near an
agreement to acquire U S  oilfield equipment maker Dresser Rand Group
Inc  N DRC  for all cash  according to people familiar with the matter
in a move that would significantly boost the German company s oil and
gas business in North America  By acquiring Dresser Rand  Siemens
would receive the company s compressors and turbines serving the oil
and gas industry at a time when a North American drilling boom has
increased demand for energy services and equipment  A deal for Dresser
Rand  which has a market capitalization of more than  6 billion  could
come as soon as Monday  some of the people said  Siemens is expected
to pay low  to mid  80s per share  the people said  compared with
Dresser Rand s Friday closing price of  79 91  which already had been
trading higher on takeover speculation in the past several days
Discussions between the two companies are continuing and could still
fall apart  the people cautioned  asking not to be named because the
matter is not public  A representative for Siemens declined to comment
and a representative for Dresser Rand did not respond for a request
for comment  Siemens  with its cash takeover bid  has trumped a
competing offer from Swiss pump maker Sulzer AG  S SUN   which
proposed merging with Dresser Rand in an all stock deal  according to
people familiar with the matter  Sulzer  whose chairman is former
Siemens Chief Executive Peter Loescher  was hoping to convince Dresser
Rand to a merger of equals under which the combined company would be
domiciled in Switzerland  the people said  Such a tie up had the
backing of Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg s Swiss investment
firm Renova Group  which controls about a third of Sulzer and also
reported a near 5 percent stake in Dresser Rand on Friday  the people
said  Siemens has long coveted Dresser Rand  which would help it grow
its oil and gas business amid a boom in fracking  the extraction of
natural gas from deep layers of rock using high pressure fluid
injections  But  until now  it shied away from making a formal bid
balking at the company s high valuation  Dresser Rand trades at 24 6
times 12 month forward earnings  a 60 percent premium to its peers in
oil and gas equipment and services  according to Reuters data  Siemens
CEO Joe Kaeser said in July that there is no quick fix for the company
s energy business  which makes products ranging from gas and wind
turbines to transformers  and has weighed on profits  Kaeser  who took
power in summer 2013 after a boardroom coup  has been looking at
acquisitions to better round out the energy business  One move in this
direction was in May when Siemens agreed to buy the energy gas turbine
and compressor business of Britain s Rolls Royce Holdings PLC  L RR
for 785 million pounds   1 28 billion   A deal with Dresser Rand would
come only months after the German group lost out in a bidding war with

Siemens AG  DE SIEGn  said on Monday it would buy U S  oilfield
equipment maker Dresser Rand Group Inc  N DRC  for  7 6 billion in a
move that would significantly boost the German company s oil and gas
business in North America   Germany s Siemens said its  83 per share
bid was unanimously supported by Dresser Rand s board of directors
That compares with a Friday closing price of  79 91  which was up 27
percent over the past three months on takeover speculation   Within
minutes of that statement  it also announced the sale of its 50
percent stake in BSH Bosch und Siemens Hausgeraete GmbH to joint
venture partner Robert Bosch GmbH for 3 billion euros   3 85 billion
ending their more than 45 year alliance in household appliances    As
the premium brand in the global energy infrastructure markets  Dresser
Rand is a perfect fit for the Siemens portfolio  The combined
activities will create a world class provider for the growing oil and
gas markets   Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said in a statement
on Monday   Reuters reported on Sunday that the companies were nearing
a deal   The German industrial conglomerate had long coveted Dresser
Rand  which would help it grow its oil and gas business at a time when
a North American fracking boom is boosting demand for energy equipment
But it shrank in the past from making a formal bid  balking at its
high valuation  Dresser Rand trades at 24 6 times 12 month forward
earnings  a 60 percent premium to its peers in oil and gas equipment
and services  according to Reuters data   CEO Kaeser said in July the
company planned to focus on restructuring rather than acquisitions for
the moment  but would have the financial firepower for the right
acquisition target  Cash reserves stood at 8 21 billion euros at the
end of June   Siemens is targeting more than 150 million euros in
annual synergies by 2019 from the transaction  which complements
Siemens s market position in turbo compressors  downstream and
industrial applications as well as larger sized steam turbines
Siemens expects to close the Dresser Rand deal by summer 2015  while
it aims to wrap up the sale of its stake in household appliance
venture BSH with Bosch in first half of 2015   BSH will pay out 250
million euros to each of its owners Bosch and Siemens before the
transaction is completed   Siemens has trumped a competing offer for
Dresser Rand from Swiss pump maker Sulzer AG  S SUN   which had
proposed an all stock merger  according to people familiar with the
matter   Sulzer s chairman is former Siemens CEO Peter Loescher  who
Kaeser replaced in a boardroom coup last year   But other rival
bidders may be lurking  General Electric  N GE  was considering
whether to make a bid  the Financial Times cited people familiar with
the matter as saying on Friday   Any GE involvement would mean their
archrivalry picking up steam again  Siemens lost out to GE in a fierce
bidding tussle over Alstom s  PA ALSO  energy business in June   The
Dresser Rand deal would eclipse Siemens acquisitions over recent year
Siemens bought Dade Behring for  7 billion under Kaeser s predecessor
Loescher in 2007  in a deal that was widely criticized as overpriced

289,Exclusive  AIG boosting Washington lobbying effort as hiatus prompted by crisis ends,"By Douwe Miedema WASHINGTON  Reuters    Insurer American International
Group  N AIG  is ramping up its lobbying team in Washington  almost
six years after it halted such efforts following its rescue by the U S
government during the financial crisis  Many large companies deploy a
handful of staff to provide access to Capitol Hill and the White House
but AIG has employed no officially registered lobbyists since 2009
Some of its government relations positions in Washington  which
companies typically use to influence policymaking by regulators and
other government officials  have been left vacant  Yet in May of this
year  Lauren Scott started working as AIG s director for international
regulatory and government affairs in Washington  according to her
LinkedIn profile  She was previously a director of international and
insurance regulation at the American Council of Life Insurers  a trade
group  That follows the arrival in February of Mary Frances Monroe   a
former Federal Reserve supervisor who worked for a Washington
consultancy firm   as AIG s head of international regulatory in
February  also according to LinkedIn  Scott and Monroe did not respond
to requests for comment  AIG declined to comment  The lobbying build
up comes at a critical time for the insurer  which has been subject to
new supervision by the Federal Reserve after it was designated as a
systemically important  firm by a top U S  regulatory panel  It is not
clear whether the two will officially register as lobbyists  something
that anyone spending more than 20 percent of their working hours on
influencing senior U S  policymakers needs to do  It is also unclear
how much of their work is domestic  and how much focused on
international lobbying  Monroe worked as a registered lobbyist in a
previous position  but Scott did not  according to official records
The company said in October 2008 it would stop lobbying  It had faced
public criticism when it continued to spend heavily to influence
lawmakers despite receiving a  182 billion bailout that gave the
government a majority stake  and because it continued to pay staff big
bonuses  The company  which says it has customers in more than 130
countries and jurisdictions  almost collapsed when a little known
London unit  AIG Financial Products  racked up colossal losses through
complex derivative transactions it had engaged in  But it is now
slowly returning to normal  and has repaid the bailout funds to the
government  AIG s shares still linger at a fraction of where they were
before the crisis  but it has resolved litigation and streamlined the
business  and the company s second quarter profit beat expectations
earlier this month     The Financial Stability Oversight Council
which brings together all the key U S  financial regulators and is
chaired by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew  has designated AIG and one
other insurer  Prudential  N PRU   as systemically important  and is
considering doing the same with MetLife Inc  N MET   While AIG did not
fight its designation  the insurance industry is trying to convince
Congress to ease a provision in the 2010 Dodd Frank financial reform
law that applies strict bank capital standards to  systemically
important  insurers  They argue the bank specific approach is a bad
fit for insurers  distinct business model    RAMPING UP AIG spent  11
million on lobbying Congress in both 2007 and 2008   putting it among
top spenders of that period  along with other major companies such as
General Electric  N GE  and Exxon Mobil  N XOM    but it quickly
pulled back after that  and it did not spend at all in either 2010 or
2011  official records show  In 2012  it started spending again
paying  120 000 for the services of law firm Patton Boggs when AIG was
selling a majority stake in one of its units  In 2013  it spent  140
000  and so far this year  80 000 with the same firm  now called
Squire Patton Boggs  or with Ernst   Young  according to the Senate
lobbying database  Its Political Action Committee  or PAC   a fund to
donate to election campaigns   donated  337 358 in 2008  with
politicians on both sides of the aisle benefiting  but the
organization has been dormant after 2010  However  AIG in a recent job

290,Rolls Royce says 2014 on track  to return to growth next year,"By Sarah Young LONDON  Reuters    Aero engine maker Rolls Royce said
it was on track to return to growth next year  after profits fell as
expected in the first half due to shrinking defense spending  a strong
pound and a struggling marine business  The company kept its guidance
for profit excluding foreign exchange movements to be flat this year
reassuring investors who were fearing an unpleasant surprise  Rolls
Royce alarmed markets in February by announcing there would be a pause
in profit growth in 2014  ending a decade of continuous rises as the
company absorbed the impact of declining U S  and European military
budgets  Shares in the company lost 1 7 percent to trade at 1 037
pence at 0556 ET  lagging Britain s blue chip index which was flat
despite a first half performance which analysts said was better than
expected   There is still a hill to climb in the second half and the
skeptics out there aren t going to get completely comfortable until
the third quarter management statement  We re caught in a holding
pattern until we get more medium term guidance   Liberum analyst Ben
Bourne said  Rolls Royce  which has said that this year s profits
would be two thirds weighted to the second half  is scheduled to
provide its next update to the market in October  The world s second
largest maker of aircraft engines behind U S  group General Electric
on Thursday posted underlying pretax profit of 644 million pounds   1
09 billion  in the six months to June  beating a consensus forecast of
607 million  Rolls Royce  which made 1 76 billion pounds in pretax
profit in 2013  also reiterated guidance for flat profit this year
But that failed to fully convince analysts  whose consensus forecast
stands slightly below that at 1 65 billion pounds  according to
Thomson Reuters data   While there are challenges  we maintain our
full year guidance for the group   Chief Executive John Rishton said
in a statement  They include difficulties in its marine business
which supplies power systems to ships  where profit was seen down 15
percent to 25 percent this year  worse than the 10 percent decline
forecast in May  The company said improvements in other parts of the
business would compensate for the shortfall in marine profits
Espirito Santo analyst Edward Stacey said the nuclear and energy
division s strong profit growth   estimated by the company at around
30 to 40 percent   would help compensate for marine s poor performance
but noted that under a deal struck earlier this year  Rolls Royce had
already agreed to sell part of this division   So actually the ongoing
Rolls Royce businesses are a bit weaker than previous guidance   he
said  when asked about the share price weakness  Rolls Royce agreed in
May to sell part of its energy and nuclear division   specifically its
energy gas turbine and compressor business   to Siemens in a 785
million pound disposal  a deal it expects to complete at the end of
the year  Guidance for flat profits was excluding currency headwinds
Rolls Royce said  repeating what it said in May  It added that it
expects foreign exchange moves to shave about 70 million pounds off
profit this year given current rates  The pound has gained over 3
percent over the past six months against a trade weighted basket of
currencies  making foreign exchange drag a common theme for British
companies reporting first half earnings   The story is corrected to

295,Alstom minority investors criticise GE deal,"By Natalie Huet and Benjamin Mallet  PARIS  Reuters    Minority
shareholders in Alstom  PA ALSO  criticised its planned tie up with
General Electric  N GE   saying they had not been given enough
information  and some voiced concern about the French government s
influence as a result of the deal   The French train and turbine maker
last month agreed a  16 9 billion deal with GE that will see the U S
conglomerate acquiring most of Alstom s energy business  The deal
which sparked a two month tug of war with the government  is expected
to close in the first half of 2015   The deal will have to win the two
thirds majority approval from Alstom shareholders during an
extraordinary meeting in the fourth quarter  Alstom Chief Executive
Patrick Kron told the firm s annual shareholder meeting in Paris on
Tuesday   It is not clear at this stage whether the firm s biggest
shareholder Bouygues  PA BOUY   with a 29 percent stake  will take
part in the vote or accede to calls from some minority investors to
step aside because of its role in the deal   The government gave its
blessing to the tie up only after it won the option to buy 20 percent
of Alstom from the construction group   With the second biggest Alstom
shareholder having a stake of about just 5 percent  minority investors
could play an important role if Bouygues decides not to participate in
the vote   A Bouygues spokesman declined to comment   Throughout
Tuesday s shareholder meeting  several minority shareholders voiced
concern over the future shape and governance of the firm  which will
be refocused on transport and is set to have the French state as its
top shareholder   Colette Neuville of shareholder lobby ADAM
complained that minority investors had not been given enough
information on the value of Alstom s various assets  She noted that
Alstom shares had slumped over 10 percent since the deal was announced
I think this slump in shares is due to the fact we don t really know
what role the state will play in the future Alstom   she said   CASH
The government had threatened for weeks to veto the sale of most of
Alstom s power arm to GE  saying it would not let a strategic power
and rail group be  devoured  by a foreign firm   It pressured GE to
dramatically reshape its offer to include commitments to create local
jobs and set up joint ventures giving Alstom a future in the power
sector  Alstom will also buy GE s rail signalling unit as part of the
deal   The government agreed to the deal after it won the option to
buy Alstom shares from Bouygues  saying the move would help ensure
that GE fully meets its demands   Alstom will be reaping 12 35 billion
euros from the GE deal  but will re invest about 2 5 billion euros
into three 50 50 joint ventures created in its electricity grid
renewable energy and nuclear power businesses   Alstom has said it
plans to use the proceeds to pay off debt  strengthen its transport
arm via acquisitions and return cash to shareholders  but has not
provided a breakdown   On Tuesday  Kron said only that Alstom would
have 7 5 billion euros cash in excess of what is needed to pay off its
3 billion euros of debt   Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Tissot said
on the sidelines of the meeting that after investing in the joint
ventures and buying GE s rail signalling unit  Alstom would be left
with around 4 3 billion euros in cash   Alstom shares closed 1 1
percent lower    Analysts at JPMorgan have cut their price target to
27 euros a share from 33 euros  below analysts  consensus for 31 euros
stressing that GE s amended deal came with less cash and more
complexity    What a shame  it could have been so good   they wrote
They said GE s initial offer would have provided Alstom with a  clean
start  as a company refocused exclusively on transport  They now
expect from Alstom a cash distribution of 6 euros per share  compared
with up to 18 euros with GE s original offer     Editing by James

301,Siemens Seeks Talks Before GE Buys Alstom,"By    Alstom s  ALSO PARIS  arch rival Siemens wants talks with the
struggling French engineering group  the German company said on Sunday
the day General Electric Company  NYSE GE  boss Jeff Immelt is due in
Paris to thrash out a deal to buy Alstom s global power arm  Siemens
AG NA  SIEGn XETRA  said in a statement that it had written a letter
to  signal its willingness to discuss future strategic opportunities
with the French group  France s government has said it wants to find
alternatives to the GE offer  which sources say puts a value of  13
billion on the turbines and power grid equipment business and could be
announced in days   Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg said last week
that he plans a meeting with Immelt  A spokeswoman for Alstom  also a
maker of railway rolling stock  had no immediate comment and could not
confirm receipt of the letter  Sources close to the French government
on Saturday flagged a likely meeting between Montebourg and Immelt on
Sunday  They said Prime Minister Manuel Valls might also meet the CEO
head of one of the world s 10 largest investor controlled companies
should the more senior politician return from a visit to Rome in time
GE had no comment late on Saturday  French media said last week that a
decisive Alstom board meeting  the second since Friday  would also
take place on Sunday  Socialist Montebourg has been a strong exponent
of France s traditionally cautious approach to foreign takeovers of
companies in flagship industries  Last week he said he would protect
the national interest and study  other solutions and scenarios  for
Alstom  also the maker of TGV high speed trains and one of France s
top private sector employers  which is struggling with heavy debt and
weak demand  Speaking ahead of the Siemens statement amid intense
speculation it would not stand idly by  one source close to the talks
said the government had been looking for alternatives for months
without success   So I don t see what they will find now   the source
said  DEJA VU SIEMENS Political sensitivities about a French national
champion run deep  and a deal with Siemens foundered partly because of
them a decade ago when Alstom was rescued by a state backed
restructuring  The plan had been to swap of Alstom s power business
with Siemens  rail business  French politicians see a GE deal in a
similar light   I ask you  prime minister  to please tell the
shareholders and management of the groups concerned that this transfer
of control is out of the question   former Socialist minister Jean
Pierre Chevenement said in an open letter to Valls  The source close
to the talks said GE would argue there was not much concern about job
cuts in France  where Alstom employs 20 percent of its workforce
about 18 000 people  The source noted that in gas turbines  for
example  GE has its own turbine business in France while some of
Alstom s is in Switzerland   The French state is asking for assurances
from GE  all that is a game that implies a discussion around the
disappearance of national champions   said the source   Conversely  GE
will try not to offer too much   Sources have said a GE deal is backed
by Alstom s main shareholder  French conglomerate Bouygues  BOUY PA
which holds a 29 percent stake  Alstom s Kron told union officials on
Friday he was discussing an  industrial operation  but did not name GE
Bouygues and GE have declined to comment  TRANSFORMATION A deal to
sell Alstom s power assets  which account for about 70 percent of
total group revenue  would effectively break up the engineering group
and leave Alstom as a pure transport business building its well known
high speed TGV trains  other rolling stock and transport industry
equipment  It could  however  be less politically sensitive than a
full takeover offer for the company  talk of which caused Alstom
shares to soar on Thursday  Since its bailout in 2004  Alstom relies
heavily on orders from national rail operator SNCF and utility EDF
EDF PARIS   It employs 93 000 worldwide  with about half of its French
total of 18 000 in the power business  Alstom s power assets include
turbines for coal  gas and nuclear power plants  wind farms and
systems for power transmission and distribution  The trading of Alstom
shares was suspended on Friday after Bloomberg reported that GE
planned a full takeover of the company  Before the report  Alstom
shares had slumped 20 percent in 12 months on concerns over its cash
flow  prompting Bouygues to take a  1 9 billion writedown on its stake
in February  Alstom is less than one twentieth the size of GE and much
smaller than Siemens  too  Its orders have slumped since the 2008
economic crisis depressed demand for power equipment   Article by

302,A New Frontier For General Electric,"By    General Electric Company  NYSE GE  is a proponent of additive
manufacturing  a broad category of manufacturing which includes the
fashionable and fascinating phenomenon of 3D printing  Additive
manufacturing builds objects by adding parts together in layers
rather than taking raw material and  subtracting  excess material away
from fitted molds  as in traditional  subtractive  manufacturing
Additive manufacturing is not new  but was typically used for small
plastic prototypes of objects  aiding design tweaks   But mass
production of metallic objects fit for actual industrial use  built up
layer by layer and modeled through software  has sparked excitement in
manufacturing  We spoke to General Electric s Christine Furstoss  the
company s technology director for manufacturing and materials
technologies  Q  A lot has been written about GE s 3D printed fuel
nozzle for its aircraft engines  Could you explore other applications
of 3D printing or additive manufacturing at General Electric  A  In
Oil   Gas and in Power   Water  initially we re looking closely at our
combustion systems  We invest a lot in that technology  because we
continuously want to lower emissions and reach higher efficiencies
with more effective uses of fuel and fuel flexibility  Combustion
systems and all their associated systems have very complex pieces
Using additive allows us to try some very novel ways of looking at
design  Emissions and fuel efficiency performance is a large thrust
here  This involves multi piece fabrication  small machine parts  and
injection molded parts that have to be combined  These are very
intricate combinations that had to be welded together  brazed together
so we can get more tested faster  and accelerate the design process
for new products across turbomachinery and combustion  For many of our
turbomachinery businesses   which captures Aviation  Power   Water
Oil   Gas   we re using additive technology for repairing and
servicing parts  such as gears  structural components  casing and even
some aerodynamic blades   Some turbomachinery helps run the pumps
which get oil out the ground   We re very bullish on using additive
manufacturing to help service parts in the field  Whether repairing
existing parts or building new ones  this opens up new business models
on servicing our equipment  We can give spare parts to our customers
in a very cost effective and fast way  Q  What are some obstacles to
widespread industrial adoption of 3D printing  A  Let me list three
things that will cause step changes in the adoption of additive 3D
printing  One breakthrough will come when we have better closed loop
control  That s the whole issue around control systems  That s the
heart of automation  which some people view as older technology   but
for me that s the game changer  Everything must be combined with
different sensors or inspectors  looking at things that impact the
final properties of the part   like how quickly a laser moves  what
power it runs at  how thin that surface is  how thick you re building
each layer  That control of properties controls the parameters of the
final part to such a high degree  You want to be sure that if things
start to drift or get misaligned  that the machine senses it and can
compensate  It should be an interesting engineering problem  but one
that can be solved  Let s remember that we re working with lasers and
metals  It s hard to sense and these processes are occurring at
temperatures well over 2000 degrees  How do you make sense of these
signals and how do you do it in real time  Second  we need a better
fix on the materials used during additive 3 D printing  In the polymer
world  there are very good large industrial producers  like Sratasys
Ltd   NASDAQ SSYS  3D systems  But their material sets are very unique
to their equipment  How do you identify and qualify such materials
when you get into the metals world  not just plastics   These
materials have to flow very easily  because we re ingesting them into
machines  You need flow  since you don t want to clog things up  but
in the end you must have properties that can make aircraft engines  so
they have to have certain material properties    Companies that
dedicate themselves to materials for 3D printing are just starting to
emerge  The more we can learn about the final product and the
materials  the more on that relationship  the better  It s in its
infancy  Companies who understand enough about metal powders and the
actual additive process  enough to tailor their material for the
process  are only just emerging  Thirdly  the whole area of inspection
We can print shapes that are so complex and almost unbelievable  but
are all the tolerances met  How do we make sure every surface  every
size  and the roughness is where we need it to be  Q  The U S  seems
to be a leader in 3D printing technology  Why  Who are some other key
players  A  3D printing is the ultimate digital meets physical world
It s the ultimate in using software to virtually design components
then rapidly trying out new concepts and putting them into form  For
all the testing we talk about  software is really the heart of 3D
printing  The software used is very important to understanding what
additive can do  For instance  you sometimes have to design the part a
little differently to compensate for things that ll happen while
manufacturing  The fact is that the U S  is a leader of software
development  and we have the initiative to see the  Brilliant Factory
We re leading not only because of our heritage in manufacturing  but
also our prowess in software  But Germany has many of the machine
makers  too  so they have a strong lead  They have a great Fraunhofer
institute  which at a high level is roughly equivalent to our National
Lab system  They have a tremendous capability in additive  Q  Some
analysts are skeptical of 3D printing beyond the novelty of the
technology  predicting that it ll only impact a small slice of global
manufacturing  Does that concern you  Does that matter  A  It doesn t
matter as long as we continue to have some scale at both the machine
and materials level  Besides the machines and materials  there s also
the software production  So there doesn t need to be massive scale
Even between 5 and 20 percent  and we can debate what that number is
it could easily be 20 percent   that s a nice scale across the world
and pretty good volume  So long as there s a continuous push for a 3D
printing ecosystem  I think we ll be fine  But I do contend that
additive will touch more of the economy than just the industrial
economy  I think the use of additive 3D printing tech for things like
tooling will grow at the most rapid pace  These are parts that are a
little simpler and more forgiving on the needed material properties
because you re using them as tools  A big push for us is making small
batches of parts to use in test vehicles  There additive is making an
impact  If you look at the number of parts that will be touched by
additive  maybe prototyped or made by tools made by additive  the
economic impact quickly climbs",2014-03-18,International Business Times
303,How Liquid Natural Gas May Revolutionize Shipping  And Make Goods Cheaper ,"By    ISTANBUL    At a noisy  bustling shipyard 20 miles south of
Istanbul  the world s second ever tugboat powered by liquefied natural
gas  LNG  sits at the end of a pier  awaiting its first water trial
Then it s off to Norway   said with no little pride Ruchan Civgin  the
contracts manager at Sanmar Shipyard  of the 115 foot vessel   The
first boat left in January   Further south along the Marmara Sea coast
another shipbuilder is rolling out LNG powered fish feed vessels  used
to transport feed for fish farms  for international markets  These
ships may be the vanguard of a global boom in LNG powered shipping
produced by the explosion in U S  fracking and by new international
emissions restrictions  Liquid natural gas may end up turning global
shipping on its head  as shipping companies look for an edge in their
battle to cut costs and reduce carbon footprints  The world as we know
it today would not exist without the behemoths that traverse the high
seas  An astonishing 80 percent of global trade is carried by ship
the Nikes on your feet  the gasoline in your car  the Toyota Prius in
your driveway all came on container ships  In February  San Diego
based TOTE Shipholdings ordered the world s first LNG powered
container ships  It also plans to convert its fleet of four ships to
LNG power   The biggest driver is the environmental benefits of LNG
said Ben Christian  TOTE project manager  In January  the Mississippi
based Gulf Coast Shipyard Group launched the first of six LNG dual
fuel offshore supply vessels  the first of their kind in the Gulf of
Mexico  And in Europe  French operator Brittany Ferries recently
ordered a massive  2 500 passenger LNG powered passenger ferry
expected to enter service in 2017  General Electric NYSE GE and
petroleum giant Royal Dutch Shell LON RDSA are also looking to get in
on the act  Fuel typically amounts to 70 percent of the overall cost
of moving a container ship from A to B  most ships today run on cheap
dirty bunker fuel  It s a dense oil residue said to contain 2 700
times more toxic sulfur than vehicular fuels  According to studies
cited by the watchdog group Transport   Environment  air pollution
from shipping causes 50 000 deaths in Europe alone every year
Regulations to be introduced by the International Maritime
Organization next year and in 2020 will make high sulfur fuels  such
as bunker fuel  illegal for use in ships sailing in numerous emission
control zones around the world  Enter LNG  which  unlike bunker fuel
contains no harmful sulfur dioxide  emits 26 percent less carbon
dioxide  and produces almost zero smoke  And it s cheaper than bunker
fuel too  According to Tim Delay  vice president of fuels for liquid
natural gas distributor Pivotal LNG  a unit of AGL Resources Inc  NYSE
GAS  gas contains more energy than bunker fuel  In the U S   he said
this works out to around  100 per metric ton cheaper than bunker fuel
The relative low price of natural gas and LNG compared to current high
residual bunker and distillate fuel prices in the U S and Europe has
added to the attractiveness of LNG   wrote Frederick Adamchak  an
adviser at New York based brokerage Poten   Partners  in an industry
publication last year  America is also flush with gas  the U S  Energy
Information Administration estimates there s enough of it underground
to last 92 years at expected demand  And yet  of the 87 000 vessels
that make up the global fleet today  LNG ships number just 50  So why
isn t everybody converting their ships to a cheaper  abundant  cleaner
fuel   LNG presents challenges  building and converting ship engines
takes time and is expensive  That s an important consideration in an
industry where profit margins  hit hard by overcapacity after the
global financial crisis  have shrunk in recent years  Hundreds of LNG
bunkering and refueling facilities will also have to be built at ports
around the world   As of today  the infrastructure of LNG supply is
limited and installation of LNG engines is an expensive investment
But LNG might be a viable solution for new built container vessels
sometime in the future when the infrastructure is in place   said
Mikkel Elbek Linnet  a spokesman for shipping giant Maersk Line  a
unit of Denmark based AP Moeller Maersk A S  CPH MAERSK A   Analysts
say the number of ships converted to LNG will increase 20 fold by 2020
But in some cases  it s possible to reduce emissions and improve fuel
consumption by using recycled engine heat and more efficient engines
rather than invest in an LNG conversion  Maersk Line is doing just
that with the launch last year of the first of a fleet of 20 massive
Triple E  container ships  slow sailing giants    the longest ships in
the world at 400 meters  1 312 ft     that recycle engine heat  Maersk
says they will consume approximately 35 percent less fuel per
container than some smaller vessels  However  many major ports have
already started the move to gas  The Belgian port of Antwerp  Europe s
second busiest container port after Rotterdam in the Netherlands
expects to open bunkering facilities for LNG powered ships at the end
of next year  In February  ground was broken on America s first such
facility at Port Fourchon  La  TOTE Shipholdings wouldn t say how much
it expected to save by using LNG on its container carriers working the
Jacksonville   Puerto Rico route  But on a grander scale  vessels
running on American LNG operating intercontinental routes could
potentially save hundreds of thousands of dollars per journey  With
gas prices forecast to remain steady for at least the next five years
cheaper shoes and cars may not be far off for North American consumers",2014-03-29,International Business Times

305,SEC Eyes Whistle blower Protection Expansion,"By    The Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  is trying to expand
the definition of a corporate whistle blower to boost protections for
potential whistle blowers  but the SEC s latest such effort has come
too late for at least one person  The Securities and Exchange
Commission filed an amicus brief Thursday in a case involving a German
company  arguing that securities rules protect whistle blowers whether
they report to their employers or to the commission directly  That s a
distinction with a very real difference  at least to Khaled Asadi  an
Iraqi employee of General Electric Company  NYSE GE  who worried that
GE hired another Iraqi specifically to  curry favor  with Iraqi
utility officials  He raised his concerns with the company   About a
year later  Asadi was fired  according to court documents in a
wrongful termination civil suit he filed against GE  Asadi alleged
that he d suffered retaliation as a whistle blower flagging corporate
wrongdoing  like violations of anti bribery laws  even though statutes
forbid such retaliation  But Asadi lost his case on appeal  Judges in
the Fifth Circuit ruled that Asadi failed to qualify as a whistle
blower because he reported to his employer internally  and not to the
SEC specifically  They cited arguments made by GE s attorneys  GE
declined to comment to IBTimes  but in its court case the company
argued that Asadi wasn t protected by the anti retaliation laws he
invoked  GE s attorneys added that Asadi s allegations of securities
violations by GE weren t backed with sufficient evidence   The
whistleblower protection provision unambiguously requires individuals
to provide information to the SEC to qualify for protection   reads
the July 2013 ruling  An earlier court ruling in the case added that
whistleblower protections don t necessarily extend beyond U S  borders
so whistleblowers abroad may be left unprotected  In its recent filing
the commission weighed in on a pending lawsuit against Siemens AG  FRA
SIE    which is based in Muenchen  Germany   Securities laws recognize
that internal company reporting by employees and others is important
for deterring  detecting  and stopping unlawful conduct   argued the
SEC in its amicus brief  The SEC clarified its position on the same
point in earlier rule making  though judges in the Asadi case recently
dismissed their position as both inconsistent and defying
Congressional intent  Other court rulings on the definition of whistle
blower were mostly lower court decisions  said Motley Rice LLC lawyer
Rebecca Katz to IBTimes in November 2013  Lower courts took an
expansive  view of whistle blower protections  wrote Katz in an
earlier blogpost  mirroring other commentary    The Asadi decision  is
the only Circuit Court decision on the definition of  whistleblower
and the eligibility to obtain anti retaliation protections   she said
at the time in an email  In the Siemens case  whistleblower
definitions are also partly at stake  though judges argued that
plaintiff Meng Lin Liu s Taiwanese residency status left him
ineligible for protection  Liu alleged that Siemens China engaged in a
kickback scheme  selling health care equipment at inflated prices to
North Korean and Chinese public hospitals  and claimed he was fired
for reporting that internally  Other securities laws  like the 2002
Sarbanes Oxley Act  protect whistleblowers  but offer lesser monetary
rewards  The SEC s whistle blowing program allows informants to
receive up to 30 percent of money collected if an investigation is
successful  The largest award so far has come to over  14 million
Asadi s attorney Ronald Dupree doesn t plan to appeal Asadi s case to
the Supreme Court   The SEC s thorough and concise brief reflects
Congressional intent to protect employees who come forward with
information regarding securities law violations   he told IBTimes in
an email   These rules were intended to prohibit companies from
retaliating against employees in these situations   Hopefully the 2nd
Circuit will agree with this reading of the statute   Thousands of
whistle blowing tips have been received  but only a handful have
resulted in rewards to whistle blowers    For foreigners  which
arguably includes Asadi alongside Liu  whistleblowing may present both
risks and rewards  Foreign citizens can receive whistle blower rewards
under the Dodd Frank Act  but may be legally unprotected from
retaliation by their employers  Katz told IBTimes earlier",2014-02-21,International Business Times
306,US Manufacturing Group  Reports Of The Sector s Death Are Greatly Exaggerated,"By    Manufacturing is the lifeblood of the global economy and indeed
making a comeback  but there is a lot the U S  should do to propel the
industry forward  Jay Timmons  president of the National Association
of Manufacturers  NAM   said Tuesday during a State of Manufacturing
address   We re definitely making solid progress   he said   But there
are challenges ahead   Those challenges include the highest corporate
taxes in the world  a shortage of trade agreements  a gap in science
technology  engineering and math skills  enforcing intellectual
property rights  compliance costs and regulatory confusion  demands of
the Affordable Care Act and a lack of long term perspective among
policymakers  Timmons said at the luncheon hosted by the Greater
Houston Partnership  a business and economic development organization
that has made helping the manufacturing industry grow its primary
issue for 2014    Government overreach poses the biggest threat to us
Timmons said  NAM is the largest industrial trade group in the U S
and lobbies Congress to adopt its favored policies  This year  Timmons
would like to see lower taxes and more trade agreements  like Canadian
Prime Minister Stephen Harper has accomplished for Canada and
attracted some American companies like Microsoft to move some offices
across the border  But for all the challenges  Timmons is optimistic
that the more than one million Americans working in manufacturing can
continue to regrow the industry from its dive during the recession  He
applauded young people for choosing manufacturing jobs and the
military for providing the necessary skills to its members  NAM has
been working with General Electric Company  NYSE GE  and veterans to
find them manufacturing positions that match their skills  GE s CEO
Jeff Immelt is also optimistic  When asked Monday at the Bloomberg
Energy 2020 conference what he was most excited about  he said the
reinvention of manufacturing   People think it s slowing   Immelt said
That s wrong  Manufacturing is being digitized  democratized  and the
science is awesome  I mean  really awesome   Since 2009  the
manufacturing sector has grown 18 percent  Last year  manufacturing
contributed  1 trillion to the economy and supported 11 3 million jobs
Manufacturing Alliance forecasts that the industry will grow by 300
000 jobs a year if manufacturing rises from 12 percent to 15 percent
of the economy   That s not all that hard to imagine because that s
exactly where we were last decade   Timmons said  He credits
innovation  like the industrial and energy efficient fans from
Kentucky based Big Ass Fans  and cheaper energy through natural gas
for the growth in manufacturing   The shale revolution is big  and you
all certainly here in Texas understand that already but more Americans
need to understand how the shale revolution is going to transform
everything that we do in this country   he said   It will give us a
long term comeback in the manufacturing industry  That is  unless
Washington gets in the way",2014-02-25,International Business Times

underlying softening of demand  Investors were looking ahead to
testimony by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Thursday for
insight as to whether or not the U S  central bank will maintain the

308,GE s Postmodern Refrigerator   It ll Be Here In 2020,"By    General Electric Company  NYSE GE  plans to revolutionize fridge
technology  as fresh research enables us to replace traditional fridge
compressors with sophisticated magnet technology  GE scientists in a
Louisville  KY lab estimate that the revamped fridges are 20 percent
more energy efficient  That could help consumers cut electricity bills
though the technology may only be commercially available in 2020
This magnetic coil technology has real potential to increase the
energy efficiency of cooling devices   said GE s lead project engineer
Michael Benedict at a Thursday video conference   It s not just
refrigeration  It could be air conditioners  or things that make
things warm  Anytime you want to move heat around  this magnetocaloric
technology can help get this done   he said  The system exploits a
metal alloy  which takes on special properties within magnetic fields
A regenerator hosts magnetic coils  through which fluids are passed
and which is readied within a magnetic charger  All this helps move
heat out of fridges into the kitchen  similarly to how fridges
currently work    Energy efficiency for modern fridges peaked within
the past decade  and a serious breakthrough was required to boost
efficiency beyond tweaking standard vapor compressors  according to GE
That technology has been widely used for the past hundred years
making this the most significant breakthrough in fridge tech for
decades  said the company   LINK TO RELEASE  General Electric has
worked on this research since 2006  Fridges are a highly visible
business for company s GE Appliances unit  though consumer appliances
make up a tiny slice of the company s profits  which come mostly from
its financial and industrial operations  There are an estimated 150
million refrigerators in the U S  alone  General Electric s Home
Business Solutions units  which includes consumer appliance sales
earned  8 billion in revenue in 2012  relative to  46 billion earned
by GE s financial arm then  Now GE scientists are working to slim down
the size and cost of the new fridge system  which now costs up to four
times more than the standard system  Prototypes have moved from
elaborate cart size systems to shoebox equivalents  though the company
aims for a device which resembles an oversized can  Magnetocaloric
cooling is not new  It s been around for over a century  and
scientists even won a Nobel Prize around 1900 for achieving low
temperatures with the science  But previously such setups were used in
scientific applications to achieve absolute zero temperatures and
couldn t be deployed commercially  New materials which came close to
room temperatures and which could shift temperatures more subtly only
emerged 15 years ago  enabling commercial research   These things are
on 24 hours a day   said Venkat Venkatakrishnan  research and
development director for GE Appliances   For the overall country and
the grid  it s going to save a phenomenal amount of energy   General
Electric worked with U S  government funded Oak Ridge National
Laboratory in Tennessee on the project  Recycling fridges will also
become easier with the technology",2014-03-13,International Business Times
309,General Electric   Talk About A Global Footprint,"By    Industrial heavyweight General Electric Company  NYSE GE  said
on Friday that it drew revenues of more than  1 billion from each of
24 countries last year  with six new countries hitting that threshold
in 2013  Those six countries include developed European economies like
Norway and Switzerland  alongside emerging markets like Thailand
Indonesia  Turkey and Algeria  The  268 billion market cap
conglomerate won a  2 7 billion contract for gas and steam turbines
and other energy equipment  from an Algerian state owned group in
September 2013  in one of the largest power agreements in GE history
Over the past decade  General Electric has moved from a company with
heavy U S  exposure to one with more than half its business coming
from outside America  said GE CEO Jeff Immelt at a March 2013 economic
summit          Immelt revealed then that they d sold 279 gas turbines
to U S  customers in 2000  but sold only 3 in 2012  but didn t seem
worried  He said that was due to a declining U S  energy market  and a
power bubble from 1999 to 2000  adding that GE retained its market
share  Here s an infographic illustrating GE s global reach  In 2012
it earned over  1 billion in 18 countries  Their research and
development spending has been upped from 2 percent a decade ago  to
five percent now  said the company     GE Grows Its Global Footprint
GE Website Jan 17 2014  General Electric Company Website  GE also
reported fourth quarter and full year earnings on Friday morning
showing strong growth in its industrial businesses  The company has
worked to boost industrial sales recently  and to slim down its
significant reliance on its financial services arm  GE Capital  They
reported 13 percent more orders in growth markets  relative to 3
percent rise in European orders  and led by a significant 25 percent
sales boost in China   We are increasingly constructive on GE s
fundamentals  particularly as its industrial earnings  aided by robust
operating margin improvement  begin to solidly outgrow the earnings of
GE Capital until 2016   wrote William Blair   Co industrial analyst
Nick Heymann in an update on Friday  following earnings  In its 2012
annual report  GE said it invests more than  10 billion each year to
launch new products and build global capacity  Notably  the company is
highly vulnerable to the global economic climate  where shifts in its
industrial end markets for its infrastructure and equipment can affect
demand and pricing for its products  Its power and water business
fared badly in 2012 on these grounds  GE targeted countries rich in
natural resources in 2012  the company noted in its annual report  Its
ability to deliver mining  transportation and energy equipment and
leverage its sheer size has been key  The company s non U S  revenues
were 57 percent of total revenue  excluding GE Capital  in 2012  They

330,WRAPUP 2 Japan says it may take months to end radiation leaks,"  Voters want coalition for better disaster handling    More bodies
recovered from tsunami hit coast    Damages bill could top  300
billion   By Chizu Nomiyama and Yoko Nishikawa        TOKYO  April 4
Reuters    Japan warned on Sunday it could take months to stop
radiation leaking from a nuclear plant crippled by a huge earthquake
and tsunami three weeks ago  while voters said a coalition would
better handle the crisis and post quake recovery effort    An aide to
embattled Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the government s priority was
to stop radiation leaks which were scaring the public and hindering
work on cooling overheated nuclear fuel rods        We have not
escaped from a crisis situation  but it is somewhat stabilised   said
Goshi Hosono  a ruling party lawmaker and aide to Kan         How long
will it take to achieve  the goal of stopping the radiation leakage
I think several months would be one target   Hosono said on a
nationwide Fuji TV programme on Sunday    In the face of the prolonged
crisis  nearly two thirds of Japanese voters believe the ruling
Democratic Party should join hands with the opposition Liberal
Democratic Party  LDP   a Yomiuri newspaper poll showed  potentially
warming lawmakers in both camps to the scheme          Kan last month
invited Sadakazu Tanigaki  head of the LDP  to join the cabinet as
deputy premier for disaster relief  but Tanigaki rejected the offer
Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co  TEPCO   found a crack in a
concrete pit at its No 2 reactor in the Fukushima Daiichi complex at
the weekend  generating readings of 1 000 millisieverts of radiation
per hour in the air inside       The leaks did not stop after concrete
was poured into the pit  and TEPCO turned to water absorbent polymers
to prevent any more contaminated water from flowing out     The latest
effort to stop radioactive water entering the Pacific started on
Sunday afternoon     We were hoping the polymers would function like
diapers but are yet to see a visible effect   said Hidehiko Nishiyama
a deputy director general of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency
Officials believe the crack may be one source of the radiation leaks
that have hobbled efforts to control the six reactor complex and sent
radiation levels in the sea to 4 000 times the legal limit
Nishiyama said three of the six reactors were now generally stable
TEPCO has said it will scrap at least four reactors once they are
under control  but this could take years or even decades
Japan s crisis has rocked the nuclear industry and the European Union
said on Sunday it will affect the fight against climate change as
energy policies are reviewed   ID nL3E7F3049    Germany and
Switzerland have said they will shut older reactors or suspend
approvals  China has suspended approvals for new plants  and Taiwan is
studying cutting nuclear output               PM UNDER PRESSURE
The 9 0 magnitude quake and tsunami on March 11 has left nearly 28 000
people dead or missing and Japan s northeast coast a splintered wreck
The disaster has hit economic production and left a damages bill which
may top  300 billion       After a three day intensive air and sea
search by thousands of U S  and Japanese forces another 77 bodies were
recovered  Kyodo news agency said on Sunday      Prime Minister Kan is
under intense pressure to steer Japan through its worst crisis since
World War Two  but after three weeks many Japanese are angry that the
humanitarian disaster seems to have taken a back seat to the nuclear
crisis    Unpopular and under pressure to quit or call a snap poll
before the disaster  Kan has been criticised for his crisis management
Voter support for the Kan s government stood at 31 percent in the
Yomiuri poll  up from 24 percent in the previous survey conducted
before the quake    Still  it also showed almost 70 percent of the
respondents believe Kan is not exercising leadership  and 19 percent
of them want him to step down soon          More than 163 710 people
are living in shelters  with more than 70 000 people evacuated from a
20 km  12 mile  no go zone area the nuclear plant  and another 136 000
people living a further 10 km out have been told to leave or stay
indoors                 MOVES TO STOP POWER BLACKOUTS   The government
estimates damage from the earthquake and tsunami at 16 trillion to 25
trillion yen   190 billion  298 billion   The top estimate would make
it the world s costliest natural disaster    Manufacturing in the
world s third largest economy has slumped to a two year low as a
result of power outages and quake damage hitting supply chains and
production     General Electric   which helped build the Fukushima

to avoid further blackouts        Japan s health ministry said on
Sunday it had detected radioactive substances higher than legal limits
in mushrooms from Iwaki in Fukushima  said Kyodo          Grown in

about this kind of thing        Milk and other foods such as mushrooms

Nomiyama and Yoko Nishikawa    TOKYO  April 4  Reuters    Japanese
engineers put dye into radioactive water on Monday to check if they
had managed to stop a leak from one reactor at the crippled Fukushima
nuclear plant but one official warned it would be months before the
crisis was under control      In the face of Japan s biggest crisis
since World War Two  one newspaper poll said that nearly two thirds of
voters want the government to form a coalition with the major
opposition party and work together to recover from the massive damage
from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami       Underlining the concern
over the impact on the world s third largest economy  a central bank
survey showed that big manufacturers expect business conditions to
worsen significantly in the next three months  though they were not
quite as pessimistic as some analysts had expected   ID L3E7F4006
An aide to embattled Prime Minister Naoto Kan said on Sunday that the
government s priority now was to stop radiation leaks from the
Fukushima nuclear plant  240 km  150 miles  north of Tokyo  and that
the situation had  somewhat stabilised         How long will it take
to achieve  the goal of stopping the radiation leaks   I think several
months would be one target   said Goshi Hosono  a ruling party
lawmaker and aide to Kan             Engineers at plant operator Tokyo
Electric Power Co  TEPCO   have been scrambling to find anything that
will help stop the leaks and prevent reactors from overheating

environmental affairs  was quoted by the Yomiuri newspaper as saying
ID L3E7F30F3            PM UNDER PRESSURE     The 9 0 magnitude quake

support for Kan s government rose to 31 percent in a Yomiuri newspaper
poll  from 24 percent in a survey conducted before the quake
Almost 70 percent of respondents  however  believed Kan was not
exercising leadership  19 percent wanting him to step down soon
There has been talk that Kan s ruling Democratic Party of Japan join
forces with its main political opponent  the Liberal Democratic Party
LDP   But so far there has been no sign the two are close to any deal
Kan last month invited LDP head Sadakazu Tanigaki to join the cabinet
as deputy premier for disaster relief  but he declined

Manufacturing has slumped to a two year low as a result of power
outages and quake damage hitting supply chains and production
The Bank of Japan s tankan business sentiment survey  although
negative  was not as grim as analysts had expected  With some
suggesting the results were not reliable            I think many firms
will have filled out the surveys before the quake and sent them after
the quake  so this reading may be misleading to gauge the impact of
the quake   said Masamichi Adachi  senior economist at JPMorgan

from the capital markets  will help Genpact s banking  financial
services and insurance  BFSI  business as the economy recovers from
the recession       BFSI has slightly better margins than the rest of
Genpact s business   Chief Executive Pramod Bhasin told Reuters
The buy widens Genpact s services portfolio  entrenches it well in the
financial vertical and makes it a one stop shop for both IT services
and business process outsourcing  BPO   Global Equities Research

yet  is the second largest this year by an Indian IT services company
after iGate s  purchase of Patni Computer Systems    ID nSGE709010

deals and are not shying away from paying a premium  They seek to
consolidate in the highly competitive space and move into higher
margin businesses  such as consulting          Genpact s offer is
about 2 5 times Headstrong s estimated annual revenue while iGate had
paid  1 2 billion  or 1 8 times Patni s revenue        The deal also

the world s top 10 investment banks and three of the top five asset
managers as its clients  the company s website showed
HEADSTRONG TO BOOST GROWTH    Genpact  which in February forecast
disappointing 2011 revenue growth of 10 13 percent  now expects to
ride on the 20 percent plus growth rate of Headstrong  which reported
2010 revenue of about  217 million          Being able to increase our
onshore presence is something we look for and it gets us closer to
customers   Bhasin said          Headstrong  founded in 1981  has most
of its delivery centres in the United States and focuses on financial
services  helps clients manage customer relationships and business
processes like help desks         This cross pollination closes deals
faster  expands deal sizes and creates a strong profitable niche
Chowdhry said           Datamonitor s Black Book of Outsourcing gave
Headstrong the top slot in financial markets IT outsourcing in its
2009 report     Genpact will fund the deal  expected to close by May

334,ANALYSIS India s manufacturing revs up as trade deficit looms,"By Matthias Williams and Lyndee Prickitt          GREATER NOIDA  India
April 18  Reuters    India s rise as an emerging market star with
seemingly insatiable demand means firms such as South Korea s LG
Electronics are doing a booming business  but the country must rev up
its manufacturing sector further or risk an unmanageable trade gap and
a slowdown in its blistering growth       The sector has started to
catch up with India s world famous IT and services industry to sate
demand for anything from cars to air conditioners to flat screen TVs
in the homes of hundreds of millions of newly affluent Indians who are
ready to splurge      The potential is vast for the likes of LG
which plans to double its India revenue in just four years pumping out
appliances every few seconds at its factory outside New Delhi
products that were seen as rare luxuries before economic
liberalisation           But creaky infrastructure  erratic policies
and a shortage of skilled labour mean factory growth has yet to emerge
from the shadows of neighbouring China s prowess     Manufacturing
makes up about a third of China s gross domestic product  GDP
compared to a 16 percent share in India  the same as it was 20 years
ago  New Delhi has set an ambitious target to raise that figure to 25
percent in a decade      Manufacturers are becoming optimistic  but my
feeling is that a huge level of manufacturing coming to India has
still too many challenges   said LG s Chief Operating Officer Yasho
Verma       This type of factory is OK  But if suppose LG decides
tomorrow it should have 20 factories in India  then it s a major
problem   he said in an interview at LG s plant         The trade
ministry has raised  serious concern  that the current account deficit
may become unsustainable as India s trade deficit is set to balloon to
278 5 billion by 2014  a twenty fold increase over a decade from the
14 3 billion in 2004      A large widening of the trade deficit can
potentially result in payments difficulties   it said in a recent
strategy document   Such a situation is simply unacceptable because it
may jeopardize the entire growth process            India can no
longer rely on a mix of its IT and service sector heft  remittances
from its citizens working overseas and capital flows to finance a huge
import bill of one of the world s fastest growing economies
Manufacturing may need to plug the gap and provide jobs for the tens
of millions expected to enter the workforce in the next decade who
cannot be absorbed in farming or IT and services         If India is
to achieve its stated goals on GDP growth and more importantly  to
generate higher levels of employment for the growing young population
India s manufacturing sector has to enter into a new orbit of even
higher growth   said a report by the Boston Consulting Group  which
suggested India s manufacturing sector should aim to grow an annual 11
percent     If India has to target a high growth of 11 percent for its
manufacturing sector over next 15 years  it needs to necessarily focus
on growing its exports much faster   it said         The government in
February estimated manufacturing growth in the 2010 2011 fiscal year
at 8 8 percent               NOT PERFECT  BUT GETTING BETTER
Reuters spoke to four executives from manufacturing firms who have set
up shop in India  The consensus was that  while things aren t perfect
they re improving rapidly and India is starting to shed its tag as a
manufacturing laggard        A maturing supplier base  the influx of
seasoned global firms and an explosion in demand have brought
transformation even in the last couple of years to a sector infamous
for its red tape  countless licence requirements and pitiful output
before liberalisation began in 1991       I ve been here living in the
country for 18 months  I ve been coming here for 10 years  and I can
tell you in the 18          months I ve seen a huge difference   said
John Flannery  the India chief executive of General Electric Co
The things that we would ask or expect of our supply chain today are
quite different than what we could even think about two years ago  So
it s changing very quickly   he said         You look at the best
companies today  the best manufacturing companies today  they re very
very sophisticated  And you wouldn t have seen that 5 10 years ago
Indian suppliers no longer work on the principle of  jugaad     a
Hindi word for muddling through problems with quick fixes that
flourished during the days of the so called  Licence Raj     which had
created a culture of short termism and inefficiency  LG s Verma said
A more sophisticated supplier base makes it simpler and cheaper for
foreign firms to set up factories on Indian soil and even look to
India as a major exporter further down the line           Cars leaving
the assembly line of General Motors in India are now up to 98 percent
locally produced  designed with the help of 2 000 engineers in the
company s Bangalore offices       Hyundai Motor Co has made India an
export hub for its vehicles  From 20 Santros sold to Nepal in 1999
the firm exported 247 102  Made in India  cars globally last year  the
highest number in any country outside the company s native South Korea
POLICY  INFRASTRUCTURE HURDLES        But India s infrastructure
development has not kept pace with the demands of its manufacturing
Power is in short supply  highways are clogged with traffic and ports
are too crowded           The average cost to move a container within
India is  945  more than double the  460 it costs in China  Due to
restrictions on goods traffic  Hyundai can only ship cars from its
Chennai plant to the coast for seven hours at night  said Arvind
Saxena  a director of Hyundai Motor India             Infrastructure
has improved     but yes  a lot still needs to be done   he said
LG s Verma would like to see the government adopt China style policies
to foster growth of Indian suppliers      The Chinese government has
spent a huge lot of money  creating cities where the vendors will be
placed  creating infrastructure there   he said   Those things are not
in focus in India       Companies have also grappled with slow or
inconsistent policy decisions from the Indian government  For example
five years ago New Delhi rolled out a policy for so called Special
Economic Zones  SEZs   hubs with long tax holidays that were set up in
Beijing s footsteps to spur manufacturing growth     But the finance
ministry slapped a 18 5 percent duty on book profits in the zones in
February s budget  sparking criticism from the trade ministry that the
tax would send the wrong signal about India s credibility with
investors   ID nSGE72908B    Karl Slym  the head of GM India  cheers
what he sees as largely business friendly policies from the government
for auto makers  But some decisions from New Delhi come out of the
blue and catch investors unawares  he said     Nobody has the chance
to be able to respond correctly or be able to manage the situation
Slym told Reuters            If you know what the outlook is  what the
playing field is  then you can plan accordingly for that  But if you
start out playing football on a football field and then all of a
sudden you re trying to play on a cricket field then you ve got the
wrong equipment to be able to perform the best   he added
Whatever its problems  the four companies interviewed by Reuters
remain largely optimistic on India s manufacturing rise  And as global
firms look to ride India s 9 percent growth story  Asia s third
largest economy has also flexed its export muscle with the growth of
domestic brands            The trade ministry has set India a target
to double its exports by 2014 to help keep the deficit in check  No
longer known just for its iconic exports such as textiles and gems
India s manufacturers are becoming household names in sectors such as
cars  generic medicines and oil products        Reliance Industries
